Attorney-General\nOctober 6, 1969. [Delivered by Lord Hodson]—\nThe appellant was convicted in the Supreme Court of Ceylon on 27th\nFebruary 1967 and sentenced to a term of two years rigorous\nimprisonment on a charge of forgery punishable under section 454 of the\nPenal Code which provides for a maximum period of five years\nimprisonment to be imposed.\nHe was granted special leave to appeal by Order of Her Majesty in\nCouncil on 13th November 1967.\nHe had been charged on 10th March I960 in the Magistrate’s Coiirt of\nBandarawela “ that on 26th August 195S he did sign a document to\nw it:\n‘ Application for a certificate of citizenship by descent, to be issued\nby the Minister of Defence and External Affairs in terms of Section 6\nof the Citizenship Act (Cap. 349) with the intention of causing it to be\nbelieved that the said document was signed by Veerappen son of\n• Thiruman, (who was born to Thiruinan and Lee homey on Sherwood\nEstate on 1st May, 1918, and in respect of whose birth the Birth\nCertificate No. 41904 had been issued by the District Registrar of\nBaduIIa on 12.C.5S) by whom or by whose authority he knew that\nthe said document was not signed, and he lias thereby committed an\noffence punishable under Section 454 of the Penal Code.’ ”\nThe offence with which lie was charged is not ordinarily triable\nsummarily by a Magistrate’s Court but the Magistrate, being also an\nadditional District Judge, assumed jurisdiction on the grounds (1) that\nthe facts were simple (2) expeditious disposal was desirable for-the offence\nwas alleged to have been committed in 105S and (3) no complicated\npoints of law arose. Though entitled to assume jurisdiction under section\n152 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code the Magistrate had no power to\nimpose any sentence but one which a District Court might lawfully\nimpose. The punishment which he could have imposed if he had found\nthe appellant- guilty was therefore limited to two years imprisonment as\nopposed to the maximum of five years laid down in section 454 of the\nPenal Code.\n.The appellant pleaded \" not guilty ”, was not called as a witness nor did\nhe ofFer other evidence save that he put in a document to which reference\nwill be made hereafter. He was acquitted on the ground that, on the\nfacts proved by the prosecution, the charge of forgery had not been\nestablished, his offence, if any, being that of cheating.\nUpon appeal by the Attorney-General to the Supreme Court against\nthe acquittal the Court held that upon the facts found by the Magistrate\nforgery within the meaning of section 453 of the Pena! Code had been\nmade put.\nThe appellant was an Indian Tamil resident in Ceylon. He.had been a\nwatcher on aii estate in Haputale. In July 195S he wrote to the Permanent\nSecretary, Ministry of Defence and External Affairs, at Colombo asking\n\nLOUD IIODSOX—Vecrappcn v. Attorney-General 3G3\ntKit his position as a citizen of Ceylon by birth under section C of the\nCilizendiip Act. Xo. IS of 194S, should be clarified and also asking\nfur an application form. He signed the letter in Tamil.\nA form was sent and filled in by him ns “ THIRUMALAI alias\nPALAXDIALAI VEERAPPEX ” . Xo jmint was made of the difference\nbetween Thiruman and Thimnialai. The appellant did however state,\nin answer to the questionnaire, that his father had been born in Ceylon\nand tint he could produce documentary evidence of his own birth in\nCeylon, the point being that he would then qualify under section 4 of\nthe Citizenship Act as a citizen of Ceylon by descent. The appellant\n.subsequently signed and sent to the Department a form of application\nverified by affidavit in which he gave his date and place of birth as\n1.5.191S Sherwood Estate, Haputalc and also gave his father’s date and\nplace of birth as 1S9S, Koslande, that is to say representing that he and\n-his father.were born in Ceylon. The application was accompanied bjr a\nbirih certificate recording the birth of one “ Vcerapcn” the- son of\n“ Tiruman ” on 1st May 191S at the Sherwood Estate. A certificate of\nCitizenship was accordingly issued to the appellant stating his name and\nplace of birth as set out in his application.\nThe prosecution proved that the appellant was not the person to whom\nthe birth certificate related. They produced (1) a birth certificate of the\nappellant’s grandson based on information supplied by the appellant\nwhich showed that the appellant was not born in Ceylon, (2) a Provident\nFund record card filled in on information supplied by the appellant\nshowing that lie was born in South India, and (3) a Labour discharge\ncertificate of less significance.\nThe decision of the Magistrate was that by enclosing the false birth\ncertificate with his application form the appellant was seeking to pass\nhimself off as the “ Vecrappcn ” son of Tiruman who had the qualification\nfor citizenship of Ceylon by descent.\nThe Supreme Court, upon these facts, reversing the decision of the\nMagistrate, held that a verdict convicting the appellant of forgery should\nbe recorded. Forgery is defined by the Penal Code sections 452 and 453\nas follows :\n“ Section 452\nWhoever makes any false document or part of a document with\nintent to cause damage or injury to the public or to any person, or\nto the Government or to support any claim or title, or to cause any\nperson to part with property, or to enter into any express or implied\ncontract, or with intent to commit fraud, or that fraud may be\ncommitted, commits forgery.\n\n364 LORD HODSON'—Veerappenv. Attorney-General\nSection 453\nA person is said to make a false document:\nFirstly who dishonestly or fraudulently makes, signs, seals, or\nexecutes a document or part of a document, or makes any mark\ndenoting the execution of a document, with the intention of causing\nit to bo believed that such document or part of a document was\nmade, signed, sealed, or executed, by or by tho authority of a\nperson by whom or by whose authority he knows that it was not\nmade, signed, sealed, or executed, or at a time at which he knows\nthat it was not made, signed, sealed, or executed ..: ”\nThe appellant by his counsel did not argue before their Lordships\nthat the conclusion of the Supreme Court as to the forgery was not\nsustainable but relied upon other matters as substantial grounds for\nsetting aside the judgment of the Sujweme Court.\nFirst he relied on the defence of “ autrefois acquit\". This defence\nwas raised before the Magistrate on 7th May 1968 by counsel who tendered\nin evidence the Charge Sheet and Record of Discharge in Joint Magistrate’s\nCourt Colombo, Case No. 29950, 28th October 1963 to 24th February\n1965. The Charge Sheet reads as follows :\n“ Accused Palanimalay Veerappan.\n1. That between the 2nd day of July, 195S and the 22nd day of\nSeptember, 1959 at Colombo within the jurisdiction of this Court,\nyou did by submitting Birth Certificate bearing No. 41904 issued\nby the District Registrar of Births, Badulla with your application for\na certificate of Citizenship in terms of Section 6 of the Citizenship\nAct (Chapter 349 L.E.C.) attempt to deceive the Hon. S. W. R. D.\nBandaranayake, Minister of Defence and External Affairs into the\nbelief that the said Birth Certificate which referred to the birth of\nVeerappan S/O Tiruman born at Sherwood, Haputale on 1st May,\n1918, referred to your birth, and thereby fraudulently attempted to\ninduce the said Hon. S. W. R. D. Bandaranayake to issue you with\na certificate of Citizenship in terms of Section 6 of the Citizenship\nAct (Chapter 349 L.E.C.) which act he would not have done had he\nnot been so deceived, and whioh act was likely to cause loss or damago\nto the Government and you have thereby committed an.offence\"\npunishablo under Section 400 read with Section 490 of the Penal\nCode.\n2. That at the time and place aforesaid and in the course of tho\nsame transaction you did for the purpose of procuring a certificate\n■f Citizenship issued in terms of Section 6 of the Citizenship Act\n(Chapter 349 L.E.C.) make a statement to w it: that you were\nVeerappan S/O Tiruman born at Sherwood Estate, Haputale Ceylon\non 1st May, 191S, knowing such statement to be false in a matorial\nparticular to wit, that, you were Veerappan S/O Tiruman a Citizen\nof Ceylon by descent and you are thereby guilty of an offence punishable\n• under section 25 of the Citizenship Aot.”\n\nLORD HODSO>f— Veerappen v. Attorney-General 365\nThe Record of Discharge in this case shows that the accused was\npresent. Then follows the word \"Evidence” and underneath appears\nthe following:\n“ Jlr. Adv. Sittampalam instructed by Mr. Siva Subramaniam for\nthe accused.\n^Ir. W. Paul C.C. for the prosecution states that the prosecution is\nnot adducing any evidence .against the accused in this case.\nJ discharge the accused.”\nThere is no indication that the appellant was called upon to plead to the\ncharge. This case can be contrasted with the procedure followed on the\ntrial with which this appeal is concerned; when the appellant on being\nasked if he had any cause to show why he should not be convicted stated\n“ I am not guilty ”.\nThe Magistrate rejected the plea of autrefois acquit on the ground\nthat the charge made under section 454 was not one of the charges'in\ncase No. 29950 but in their Lordships’ view it is unnecessary to consider\nthe question whether the substantial issues raised in the second\nproceedings are the same as those raised in the first.\nThe Record does not showr that the appellant was ever put in peril\non the first occasion. It shows the reverse namely that counsel for the\nprosecution stated that the prosecution was not adducing any evidence\nagainst the accused in the ease whereupon he was discharged.\nThere is nothing to indicate that the apjiellant was ever called upon to\nplead and a search of the Court journal has not shown any indication that\nhe w'as called upon. Tire burden being upon appellant to establish the\nplea of autrefois acquit and there being no evidence to support it this\nground of appeal is not established.\nA second point, taken somewhat tentatively on behalf of the appellant\nwas that when his Counsel stated that he was not calling any evidence\nbut made a submission in law to the effect that the evidence for the\nprosecution could not support a charge of forgery, he was making a\nsubmission of “ No case to answer ” ; and that if the Magistrate had\nover-ruled that submission justice required that he should then have given\nthe appellant an opportunity of leading evidence. Further it was\nsubmitted that the Supreme Court should not have set aside the verdict\nof acquittal entered by the Magistrate without giving the same\nopportunity to the appellant since the Supreme Court was in effect\ndoing no more than over-ruling a submission of “ No case to answer ” ,\nThere is no substance in this point. When the case for the prosecution\nwas closed on 8th July 1966 the Magistrate called on the appellant for\nhis defence. His Counsel then indicated that he w'as calling no evidence\nand confined himself to tendering the Charge Sheet and the record of\nthe earlier proceedings. The appellant’s counsel in whose hands he was,\nJ**------J 11043 (1/70)\n\n366 LORD HODSOK—Vee'rappen v. Attorney-General\nindicated plainly that he was calling no evidence apart from the document\nto which reference lias been made. In so lar as it can be inferred that\n. Counsel submitted there was no case to answer that submission was not\nover-ruled but was accepted and the Magistrate, upon the facts proved\nbefore him came to the conclusion, afterwards reversed by the Supreme\nCourt, that the offence of forgery was not established.\nThe Supreme Court, upon those facts, the only facts which the\nappellant had sought to put forward substituted a verdict convicting the\nappollant of forgery for the verdict of acquittal which the Court set\naside.\nNo injustice was done to the appellant in that the Supreme Court did\nnot, before giving judgment, give him a further opportunity of calling\nevidence.\nFinally it was submitted that there was a grave irregularity in the\nSupreme Court in that the Judgment in its final paragraph imposed a\nsentence of two years rigorous imprisonment Avithout gi\\'ing an .\nopportunity for the appellant to be heard in mitigation of sentence in\n.the event of a conviction being entered against him.\nTheir Lordships cannot uphold this objection. They vcill not as a\nrule interfere.Avith sentences. Moreover on the face of it the sentence\nis not in their Lordships’ opinion an excessive one.\nIt is recognised that, since the judgment ivas handed out by the Court\nto the parties, there was no separate opportunity given to the appellant by\nhimself or his counsel to plead in mitigation. Nevertheless notice had\nbeen given by the Petition of Appeal that the Attorney-General Avas\npraying not only to have the order of acquittal made by the Magistrate\nreversed but also that sentence might be passed on the appellant according\n.to law.\nIt was therefore open to the appellant to deal at the hearing before the\nSupreme Court Avith tho question of punishment. It is true that this is\na course which an appellant will not readily take Avhen the question of\nconviction is still in suspense. Their Lordships do not regard with\nsatisfaction the practice, if such there bo, of dealing Avith sentences without\nhearing a pica in mitigation.\nEven though appeals against acquittals may be few in number they\nregard it as highly desirable that accused persons in such cases should\nhave the opportunity after conviction by an appellate court of pleading\nin mitigation.\nFor the reasons given above their Lordships Avill humbly advise Her\nMajesty that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.",
