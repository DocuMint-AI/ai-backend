11. It is averred that in the seizure memo of psychotropic
substance itself it is mentioned that each dose of 5 ML
contains 10 mg Codeine Phosphate against permissive limit
of 100 Mg. Similarly, its concentration is mentioned 1%
against permissive limit of 2.5% in undivided preparations.
Thus, the substance seized by the police does not fall within
the definition of “manufactured drug” and is not punishable
under Section 21 of NDPS Act, 1985.
12. It is further asserted by the learned Senior counsel that
at the most, the case of the applicants falls under the Drugs
and Cosmetics Act, for which, appropriate action can be
taken by the competent authority, but in any case, they
cannot punished under the NDPS Act, 1985.
13. To bolster his arguments, learned Senior counsel has
placed reliance on two orders of co-ordinate Bench of this
Court passed in the case of Shiv Kumar Gupta vs. The State
of Madhya Pradesh dated 16.09.2015 passed in CRR
No.200/2015 and Rohit Chanda vs. The State of Madhya
Pradesh dated 15.10.2015 passed in CRR No.1621/2015
where charges were quashed when the 5 ML of Cough Syrup
was containing 10 mg of codeine phosphate in the case of
Shiv Kumar (supra) and 9.825 mg codeine phosphate in the
case of Rohit Chanda (supra) holding that the quantity of
psychotropic substance was within the permissible limit.
