9. High Court of M.P. Bench At Indore
MCRC No.26515/2018
Ranjan vs. The State of M.P.
&
MCRC Nos.46229/2018
Sandeep vs. The State of M.P.
codeine content on dosage basis can be made only
when the cough syrup is definitely kept or
transported which is exclusively meant for its usage
for curing a disease and as an action of remedial
agent.
13. As pointed out by us earlier, since the appellants
had no documents in their possession to disclose as
to for what purpose such a huge quantity of
Schedule 'H' drug containing narcotic substance
was being transported and that too stealthily, it
cannot be simply presumed that such transportation
was for therapeutic practice as mentioned in the

Therefore, if the said requirement meant for
therapeutic practice is not satisfied then in the event
of the entire 100 ml. content of the cough syrup
containing the prohibited quantity of codeine
phosphate is meant for human consumption, the
same would certainly fall within the penal
provisions of the N.D.P.S. Act calling for
appropriate punishment to be inflicted upon the
appellants. Therefore, the appellants' failure to
establish the specific conditions required to be
satisfied under the above referred two notifications,
the application of the exemption provided under the
said notifications in order to consider the appellants'
application for bail by the Courts below does not
arise."

down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Shahabuddin and
Sanjeev Deshpande cases (supra) in MCRC No. 11448/2016
order dated 13.12.2016, M.Cr.C.No.4310/2017 Gopal Gupta
Vs. The State of M.P. & Another order dated 11.05.2017,
MCRC No. 20360/2018 order dated 28.05.2018 and in
MCRC 26037 Nilesh @ Nilkamal V/s State of MP order
dated 10.07.2018. The Rajsthan High Court has also taken
the same view in the case of Ravi alias Ravikant Vs. State of
Rajasthan reported in 2016 CRI. L. J. 3309 that the gross
weight has to be considered for calculation of commercial
