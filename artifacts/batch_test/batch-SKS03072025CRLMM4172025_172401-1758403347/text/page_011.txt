a criminal case is a serious matter, and the criminal law cannot be set
into motion as a matter of course.
16. In the present case, the learned Special Judge has not recorded
any cogent reason for disagreeing with the investigating agency‟s
consistent stand in both the chargesheet and the supplementary
chargesheet that no evidence was found against the petitioner. There is
no indication in the impugned order as to what material was relied
upon to differ from the conclusion of the investigating agency or how
the petitioner could be linked either with the alleged conspiracy or the
substantive offence. The petitioner has not been arrested during
investigation, and no role has been attributed to her beyond the mere
receipt of money in her account, which the chargesheet itself explains
and does not attribute any criminal intent to.
17. Summoning an accused merely on the apprehension that letting
him or her off may create equity in favour of other co-accused –
without any supporting evidence – cannot form the legal basis for
compelling a person to undergo the rigors of trial. In the absence of
clear and sufficient reasons justifying such disagreement with the
investigation, and without any material demonstrating the petitioner‟s
involvement in the offence, this Court is of the opinion that the
summoning order is legally unsustainable.
18. Accordingly, the order of cognizance dated 08.02.2024 passed
by the learned Special Judge is quashed.
19. In view of the above, the present petition stands disposed of.
