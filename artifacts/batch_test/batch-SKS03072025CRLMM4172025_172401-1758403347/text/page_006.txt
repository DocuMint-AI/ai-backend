9. It is further submitted that the petitioner had shared her bank
account details with her husband in good faith, and had no knowledge
either of the sender or of the reason behind the remittance. Her
husband had sought her account details under the impression that he

Roy, for having assisted him and CCRT in organizing cultural
programs in remote areas of West Bengal. It is contended that the
Investigating Agency has not brought on record any new material
against the petitioner in the supplementary charge sheet, which merely
reiterates the same facts regarding the money transfer that were
already reflected in the earlier charge sheet. The petitioner‟s name, it
is argued, was mentioned only in Column No. 12 as a beneficiary,
without any overt act or criminal intent being attributed to her.

Koushik Sinha Roy and Mr. Sandip Kumar. It is stated that she had
provided her bank account details to her husband, Mr. Prosanta
Mondal, out of trust, being his wife. However, the fact remains that a
sum of ₹25,200/- was transferred from the CCRT‟s bank account into
