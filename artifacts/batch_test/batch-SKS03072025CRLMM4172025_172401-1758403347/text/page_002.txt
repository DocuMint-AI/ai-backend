2. The present FIR was registered on the complaint of Mr. G.C.
Joshi, Director, Centre for Cultural Resources and Training (CCRT),
an autonomous organization under the aegis of the Ministry of
Culture, Government of India, with its office located at Plot No. 15A,
Sector-7, Dwarka, New Delhi. The complaint was received vide DD
No. 27B dated 21.09.2017 at Police Station Dwarka South, Delhi. It
was alleged that the CCRT provides scholarships to children aged
between 10 to 14 years across various fields of art under a national-
level scheme. Several complaints were received from the parents of
selected scholarship recipients, stating that the scholarship amount had
not been credited to their accounts, despite the same having been
debited from the CCRTâ€Ÿs account. It was further alleged that one
Sandip Kumar, who had worked as a Programmer on a contractual
basis for approximately seven years, had committed the fraud by
taking advantage of a newly introduced system of transferring
scholarship amounts via RTGS/NEFT mode starting in 2014. Under
this system, the details of selected scholars, including their names,
bank details, scholarship amount, and IDs, were forwarded by the
Scholarship Section to the Accounts Section. The Accounts Section
would then send this data in soft copy to the Canara Bank located in
the same complex for processing the fund transfers. Sandip Kumar
allegedly manipulated these lists by deleting the names of actual
beneficiaries and inserting his own name, along with those of his wife
and certain associates or acquaintances. Based on the above
allegations, the present FIR was registered.
