Prasad Tiwari.” However, this Court notes that, as per the fresh
chargesheet, the specific and detailed roles of co-accused Sandip
Kumar, Vishnu Prasad Tiwari @ Rajesh Tiwari, Jay Prakash Pal @
Nanhe, Chandra Prakash Mishra, Prosanta Mondal, Kaushik Sinha
Roy, Mihir Chakraborty, Supriya Das, Tapasi Mukherjee, Deep
Mishra, and Nabendu Gupta have been clearly outlined. Therefore, the
reasoning that summoning Ms. Mili Debnath was necessary to avoid
creating equity in favour of the other accused is misplaced. Even
otherwise, if there is insufficient evidence against a particular accused,
the mere apprehension that it may create parity or equity with other
accused persons cannot, in law, be a valid ground to summon such a
person to face trial. Summoning must be based solely on the material
on record demonstrating prima facie involvement in the alleged
offence.
15. The law is well-settled that before a person can be summoned to
face trial, there must be sufficient material on record to give rise to a
strong suspicion that the person was involved in the commission of
the offence. In particular, the Court must be satisfied that: (i) the
accused was prima facie a party to the offence, and (ii) there exists
sufficient ground to justify summoning him/her to stand trial. It is
equally settled that facing a criminal trial is not a matter to be taken

including social stigma, mental agony, and reputational harm. In Pepsi
Foods Ltd. v. Special Judicial Magistrate: (1998) 5 SCC 749, the
Hon‟ble Supreme Court emphasized that summoning of an accused in
