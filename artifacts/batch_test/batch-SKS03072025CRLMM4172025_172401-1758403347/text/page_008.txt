₹15,000/- was withdrawn in cash.
The petitioner, Ms. Mili Debnath, stated that she was residing
●
with her husband and children and earned a livelihood by
giving private tuitions. She disclosed that her husband had
asked for her bank account details to receive some money, and
she had shared them in good faith. Upon receipt of the amount,
she had withdrawn ₹15,000/- at her husband‟s instructions and
had handed it over to him. She claimed to have no knowledge
of the sender or the purpose of the remittance.
During investigation, her husband, Mr. Prosanta Mondal,
●
admitted that he had provided both his and his wife‟s bank
account details to receive funds from Mr. Koushik Sinha Roy of
CCRT, purportedly for helping organize cultural events. He
confirmed that ₹25,200/- was received in his wife‟s account, of
which ₹15,000/- was handed over to him and ₹10,000/- was
adjusted by the bank.
The investigation did not reveal association of the petitioner
●
with CCRT or any of the accused persons. However, since the
sum of ₹25,200/-, allegedly being part of the cheated amount,
was received in her bank account, her name was included in
Column No. 12 of the second supplementary chargesheet as a
beneficiary.
13. This Court is of the view that there is no cavil regarding the
settled position of law that an accused can be summoned even if he or
she is shown in Column No. 12 of the chargesheet, i.e., as a suspect.
