to the prosecution witnesses and to secure the witnesses by exercising all the powers given to it under the Crl. P.C. as
already indicated by us and
if still the presence of the witnesses could not be secured and the prosecution also either on account of pronounced
negligence or recalcitrance
does not produce the witnesses after the Court had given it sufficient time and opportunities to do so, then the Court,
being left with no other
alternative, would be justified in acquitting the accused for want of evidence to prove the prosecution case, under S.
248, Crl. P. C. in the case of
warrant cases instituted on a police report and under S. 255(1), Crl. P.C. in summons cases, and we answer the two
questions referred to us in
the above terms.
23. Coming now to these appeals, we might note here that the offences with which the respondents-accused have been
charged are offences under
S. 4(1)(b) of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition Act, and those prosecutions were launched nearly four years ago. Furthermore,
the prosecution had not,
in spite of notices, attempted to produce the witnesses and in fact were quite non-co-operative in their attitude. In view
of these circumstances,
while pointing out that the acquittal of the respondents-accused in the circumstances of these cases is not proper,
inasmuch as the Court had not
discharged its duty as indicated by us as above, we do not want to interfere with that acquittal at this length of time and
hence we dismiss these
appeals.
