15. High Court of M.P. Bench At Indore
MCRC No.26515/2018
Ranjan vs. The State of M.P.
&
MCRC Nos.46229/2018
Sandeep vs. The State of M.P.
possess narcotic drugs or psychotropic substance except for
medical or scientific purposes or in the manner and to the
extent provided by the provisions of the Act or Rules or
Orders made thereunder. Nothing is shown before this Court
that the seized contraband was stored or possessed for any
therapeutic purposes. No documents, whatsoever, are
produced by the petitioners. On the contrary the contraband
was concealed among the bags of potatoes and onion. The
godown was taken for storage of vegetables, but under the
guise of vegetables, a huge quantity of psychotropic
substance was stored and being transported stealthily. All this
is sufficient to Prima facie show that the intention of the
petitioners was not bonafide.
29. In Mohd. Shahabuddin (supra) case Hon'ble the
Supreme Court has also discussed this issue and has held that
apart from the other condition, it is mandatory that the
contraband should be only for therapeutic practice.
Therapeutic practice means it should be for medicinal
purposes only or should be exclusively meant for its usage
for curing a disease and as an action of remedial agent.
30. At the cost of repetition I can refer para 13 of the
judgement, which says that "As pointed out by us earlier,
since the appellants had no documents in their possession to
disclose as to for what purpose such a huge quantity of
Schedule 'H' drug containing narcotic substance was being
transported and that too stealthily, it cannot be simply
presumed that such transportation was for therapeutic
practice as mentioned in the Notifications dated 14.11.1985
