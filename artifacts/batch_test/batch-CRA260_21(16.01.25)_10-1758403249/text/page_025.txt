Section 20(c) of the NDPS Act, we deem it appropriate to reduce
his sentence of 12 years rigorous imprisonment, as awarded to
them by the learned trial Court, to 10 years rigorous
imprisonment. So far as the default sentence is concerned, the
same is modified to the extent that in case of failure to deposit the
fine amount awarded by the trial Court, the appellants shall
undergo further rigorous imprisonment for one year instead of
three years, as awarded by trial Court. It is ordered accordingly.
29. Consequently, both the criminal appeals are partly allowed to
the extent indicated hereinabove. It is stated that the appellants
are in jail, they shall serve out the remaining sentence as
modified by this Court.
30. Registry is directed to send a certified copy of this judgment along
with the original record of the case to the trial court concerned
forthwith for necessary information and compliance and also send
a copy of this judgment to the concerned Superintendent of Jail
where the appellants are undergoing their jail sentence to serve
the same on the appellants informing them that they are at liberty
to assail the present judgment passed by this Court by preferring
an appeal before the Honâ€™ble Supreme Court, if so advised, with
the assistance of High Court Legal Services Committee or the
Supreme Court Legal Services Committee.
