10. The proviso to sub-section (1) lays down that if the
empowered officer has reason to believe that a search
warrant or authorisation cannot be obtained without
affording opportunity for the concealment of evidence
or facility for the escape of an offender, he may enter
and search such building, conveyance or enclosed
place, at any time between sunset and sunrise, after
recording the grounds of his belief. Vide sub-section
(2) of Section 42, the empowered officer who takes
down information in writing or records the grounds of
his belief under the proviso to sub-section (1), shall
forthwith send a copy of the same to his immediate
official superior. Section 43 deals with the power of
seizure and arrest of the suspect in a public place. The
material difference between the provisions of Section
43 and Section 42 is that whereas Section 42 requires
recording of reasons for belief and for taking down of
information received in writing with regard to the
commission of an offence before conducting search
and seizure, Section 43 does not contain any such
provision and as such while acting under Section 43 of
the Act, the empowered officer has the power of
seizure of the article etc. and arrest of a person who is
found to be in possession of any narcotic drug or
psychotropic substance in a public place where such
possession appears to him to be unlawful.‚Äù
