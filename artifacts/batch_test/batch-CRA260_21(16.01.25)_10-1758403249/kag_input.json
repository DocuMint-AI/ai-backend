Advocate\nHon'ble Shri Ramesh Sinha, Chief Justice and\nHon'ble S hri Ravindra Kumar Agrawal, Judge\nJudgment on Board\n\n2\nPer Ramesh Sinha, C.J.\n16/01/2025\n1. Since the aforesaid two criminal appeals arise out of same\njudgment of conviction and order of sentence, they were clubbed\n& heard together and are being disposed of by this common\njudgment.\n2. Appellant – Ambika Vishwakarma has preferred Criminal Appeal\nNo.260/2021 and Appellant – Narayan Das has preferred\nCriminal Appeal No. 349/2021 under Section 374(2) of the CrPC\nquestioning the impugned judgment of conviction and order of\nsentence dated 21.01.2021 passed by the learned Special Judge\n(NDPS Act), Surguja, Ambikapur, District – Surguja in Special\nCriminal (NDPS) Case No.04/2019, by which they have been\nconvicted for offence under Section 21 (c) of the Narcotic Drugs\nand Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (hereinafter called as\n'NDPS Act') and sentenced them to undergo rigorous\nimprisonment for 12 years and fine of Rs.1,10,000/- (each), in\ndefault of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous\nimprisonment for 3 years.\n3. The brief case of the prosecution is that on 20.09.2018, the\nInvestigating Officer Amit Gupta was posted as Sub-Inspector at\nAmbikapur Police Station. On 20.09.2018 at 19:10, Sub-Inspector\nAmit Gupta received information from an informer that two\npersons, Ambika Vishwakarma and Narayan Das, are standing\n\n3\non the side of the main road of Parsa with illegal narcotics syrup\nin a bag and are waiting for a small vehicle to come from\nAmbikapur. On the said information, notice was served to the\nwitnesses through Constable No.464 Abhay Choubey and\nwitness Manish Upadhyay, S/o Shyamdhar Upadhyay, age 35\nyears and Gurucharan Singh alias Guddu S/o late Rajendra\nSingh, age 38 years, both residents of Mayapur Ambikapur were\nsummoned and informed about the informer information and\ninformer information panchnama Ex. P-2 was prepared in front of\nthe witnesses and a copy of the information was sent to the City\nPolice Superintendent of Police, Ambikapur. Due to the City\nSuperintendent of Police being out of the office on tour and due\nto time taken in obtaining search warrant, there was full possibility\nof the goods being destroyed, hence for verification of the\ninformation without obtaining a search warrant, information about\ndeparture was sent to the City Superintendent of Police\nAmbikapur as per Ex.P-4. Thereafter, along with constable 450\nSanjiv Choubey, constable 500 Pravind Singh, constable 464\nAbhay Choubey and the above mentioned witnesses, in\nGovernment vehicle No. CG 03/6430 with necessary documents\nand kit, left for Parsa. Reaching the place mentioned by the\ninformant in village Parsa, the area was cordoned off and as per\nthe description given by the informer, both the persons were\ncaught in front of Parsa Middle School and interrogated, who told\ntheir names as Ambika Vishwakarma, son of Shiv Prasad\n\n4\nVishwakarma, resident of Chainpur, police station Lakhanpur and\nNarayan Das, son of late Ramdas, resident of village Kevra,\npolice station Lakhanpur. Both the suspects were informed about\nthe informer's information and were given notice Ex.P-6 under\nSection-50 NDPS Act, on which the suspects gave acceptance\nfor their respective search as per Ex.P-7. Thereafter, the accused\nwere made to search the witnesses, accompanying staff, and\ntheir own vehicle one by one. When no suspicious or\nobjectionable item was found with them, then search panchnama\nEx.P-4 for witnesses was prepared. Search panchnama Ex.P-9\nfor police staff and search panchnama Ex.P-10 for Investigating\nOfficer himself was prepared. Thereafter, on search of suspect\nAmbika Vishwkarma, a cement colour trolley bag with Flyte King\ncompany's monochrome was found in his possession, which was\nopened and searched. R.C. KUFF COUGH SYRUP total 143\npieces, each containing 100 ml was found in it and a backpack in\npossession of second suspect Narayan Das which was blackish\nlight sky blue in colour and of the company TYCOON was\nopened and searched which contained CODECTUS COUGH\nSYRUP 70 pieces, each containing 100 ml and ELDER QREX\nCOUGH SYRUP 23 pieces, each of 100 ml in vials with labels\ncontaining a substance called Codeine Phosphate which was a\nnarcotic drug, due to which search panchnama Ex.P-11 of the\nsuspects was prepared. The bags recovered from the possession\nof the accused and a total of 236 psychotropic substance syrups\n\n5\nwere recovered and recovery panchnama Ex.P.-12 was prepared.\nAfter reading the label on the bottles of syrup recovered from the\npossession of the accused, it was found that a substance called\nCodeine Phosphate was mixed in it. Then Narcotic Substance\nIdentification Panchnama Ex.P-13 was prepared. Notice Ex.P-14\nand 15 were issued to accused Ambika Vishvakarma and\nNarayan Das respectively to produce valid documents regarding\npossession of narcotic cough syrup. Then the accused wrote in\nnotice Ex.P-14 and 15 that they did not have any documents with\nthem. The complaint was sent to the Drug Inspector as per Ex.P-\n30 for giving opinion after physical examination of the cough\nsyrup recovered from the accused, on which the Drug Inspector\ngave his opinion as per Ex.P-32. 04 out of 143 bottles R.C.\nKUFF COUGH SYRUP, 04 out of 70 bottles CODECTUS\nCOUGH SYRUP and 04 out of 23 bottles LDER QREX COUGH\nSYRUP recovered from the possesson of accused were\nseparated for sampling and the remaining cough syrup was\nseparated and sealed separately and a seal sample panchnama\nEx.P.-16 was prepared. Thereafter, cough syrup and bags were\nseized as per Ex.P.-17 and 18. The accused were arrested and\narrest papers Ex.P.-22 and 23 were prepared respectively. The\nscene map of the incident was prepared as per Ex.P.-26. The\naccused and the cough syrup seized from them were brought to\nAmbikapur police station, where crime number-480/2018 was\nregistered against them. In the sequence of investigation, the\n\n6\nstatements of witnesses Manish Upadhyay and Gurucharan\nSingh were recorded by the Investigating Officer, Sub-Inspector\nAmit Gupta, as per their statements.\n4. After completion of investigation, charge-sheet was presented\nbefore the Court of Special Judge (NDPS Act), Surguja,\nAmbikapur (C.G.). On being reading out the charges mentioned\nin Clause-1 and explaining it to the accused, they denied the\nabove crime.\n5. In order to bring home the offence, the prosecution examined as\nmany as 09 witnesses and exhibited 61 documents in support of\ncase of the prosecution.\n6. In the trial under section 313 Cr.P.C., the accused denied the\nfacts stated by the prosecution, except for the admitted facts, and\npleaded ignorance or innocence, stating that they were falsely\nimplicated and framed. They did not examine any defense\nwitnesses.\n7. The trial Court after appreciating oral and documentary evidence\navailable on record, by its judgment dated 21.01.2021 convicted\nand sentenced the appellants as aforementioned. Hence, these\nappeals.\n8. Smt. Anju Ahuja, learned counsel, appearing for appellant -\nAmbika Vishwakarma in CRA No. 260 of 2021 submitted that\nthe learned trial Court has committed an error in holding that the\nquantity of the Narcotic Drugs was a commercial quantity, which\n\n7\nin fact was the intermediate quantity. She submitted that 4 mg\nCodeine Phosphate is available in 100 ml bottle of the drug\nCodeine, therefore, according to her submissions the actual\nquantity contained in the bottle should have been considered, not\nthe entire 100 ml. He further submitted that even if the entire\nquantity of Codeine is excluded from the total number of bottles\nseized, it would fall within the intermediate quantity, not the\ncommercial quantity. In support of her contention, she relied upon\nthe judgment passed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the Case\nof E.Micheal Raj Vs. Intelligence Officer, Narcotic Control\nBureau in Appeal (Crl.) No. 1250 of 2005 dated 11 March, 2008\nand the Judgment passed by the High Court of Delhi in Bail\nApplication No.136 of 2021 in the matter of Mohd Ahsan Vs.\nCustoms decided on 25 June, 2021.\n9. Mr. Surfaraj Khan, learned counsel, appearing for appellant –\nNarayan Das in CRA No. 349 of 2021 submitted that the\nprosecution has failed to prove this case beyond reasonable\ndoubt, because two independent seizure witnesses namely\nManish Upadhyay, PW-1 and Gurucharan Singh, PW-2 have not\nsupported the prosecution case and turned hostile. He further\nsubmitted that the provision of Section 50 of the NDPS Act has\nnot been complied with as appellants-accused have not been\napprised of their right to get searched by the Gazetted Officer or\nby the Magistrate. He also submitted that in the present case, the\nOfficer, who conducted preliminary enquiry, seized articles and\n\n8\nlodged report in the Police Station, has continued to investigate\nand filed charge sheet, therefore, the investigation is vitiated.\n10. Apart from aforesaid submissions, they further submitted that no\nspecial reason has been assigned by the learned trial Court for\nawarding punishment/sentence of more than 10 years. He relied\nupon the decisions of the Supreme Court in Sanjeet Kumar\nSingh @ Munna Kumar Singh v. State of Chhattisgarh\nreported in (2022) 16 SCC 58 and Rafiq Qureshi v. Narcotic\nControl Bureau, Eastern Zonal Unit reported in (2019) 6 SCC\n492 to bolster his submissions. Hence, the present appeal\ndeserves to be allowed in full or in part.\n11. On the other hand, Mr. Sangharsh Pandey, learned Government\nAdvocate, appearing for the State/respondent opposed the\naforesaid submissions and submitted that in view of the\nJudgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in the Case of Hira Singh\nand Another Vs. Union of India and Another reported in\n(2020) 20 SCC 272, it is apparent that the quantity so seized\nwould fall in the category of commercial quantity. He further\nsubmitted that though the independent witnesses namely Manish\nUpadhyay, PW-1 and Gurucharan Singh, PW-2 have not\nremained firm, but they have admitted their signatures in the\nseizure documents and the entire seizure of contraband has been\nproved from reliable coherent evidence of Investigating Officer-\nAmit Gupta, PW-7, who effected seizure. It is next submitted that\nas far as compliance of Section 50 of the NDPS Act is concerned,\n\n9\nInvestigating Officer-Amit Gupta, PW-7 has stated in para 4 of his\nexamination-in-chief that the accused were given notice under\nSection 50 of the NDPS Act regarding their right and only upon\ntheir consent, they were searched by the Police Officer. In para-\n19 of cross-examination, this fact has been elicited by\nInvestigating Officer-Amit Gupta, PW-7. Mr. Pandey would\nsupport the impugned judgment and submitted that the\nprosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and\nthe learned trial Court after considering the material available on\nrecord and evidence adduced by the prosecution has rightly\nconvicted and sentenced the appellants as mentioned above, in\nwhich no interference is called for.\n12. We have heard the learned appearing for the parties, considered\ntheir rival submissions made herein-above and also went through\nthe records with utmost circumspection.\n13. In the instant case, though the independent witnesses, namely,\nManish Upadhyay, PW-1 and Gurucharan Singh, PW-2 have not\nremained firm, but they have admitted their signatures in the\nseizure documents and the entire seizure of contraband has been\nproved from reliable coherent evidence of Investigating Officer-\nAmit Gupta, PW-7, who effected seizure. In this way, the\nprosecution story regarding the action taken at the spot in the\ncase in hand has not been supported by the panch witnesses.\n14. Now, it is worth considering in the case that if the fact of seizure\nof contraband article has not been proved by the independent\n\n10\nwitnesses, then whether the evidence of the police witnesses\npresented by the prosecution can be believed. In this regard, it\nhas been held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in many judicial\nprecedents that if the evidence of police witnesses is worthy of\nbelief then the accused can be convicted on the basis of their\nreliable evidence also. Similarly, in the judicial precedent\nNathusingh Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh reported in AIR\n1973 SC 2783, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has opined that there\nis no law that the statement of a police office or excise officer\ncannot be accepted in the absence of support. If the police\nofficer’s single evidence is of such a quality that it cannot\ndisbelieved, then on the basis of his sole evidence, a conclusion\ncan be drawn about the recovery of something (narcotic\nsubstance). In the context of the opinion expressed in the above\nhonorable judicial precedents, it is now to be considered whether\nas per the evidence in the case, the Investigating Officer has\nconducted the investigation by following the mandatory and\ndirective provisions of the NDPS Act which is supported by other\nevidence in the case.\n15. At this stage it has to be seen as to whether as per the provision\nof Section 42(1) of the NDPS Act, the Investigating Officer, Amit\nGupta, Sub Inspector of the Police Department is allowed to\ninvestigate or not ?\n16. Section 42(1) of the NDPS Act is reproduced hereunder: -\n\n11\n“42. Power of entry, search, seizure and arrest without\nwarrant or authorisation.- (1) Any such officer (being\nan officer superior in rank to a peon, sepoy or\nconstable) of the departments of central excise,\nnarcotics, customs, revenue intelligence or any other\ndepartment of the Central Government including\npara-military forces or armed forces as is empowered\nin this behalf by general or special order by the\nCentral Government, or any such officer (being an\nofficer superior in rank to a peon, sepoy or constable)\nof the revenue, drugs control, excise, police or any\nother department of a State Government as is\nempowered in this behalf by general or special order\nof the State Government, if he has reason to believe\nfrom persons knowledge or information given by any\nperson and taken down in writing that any narcotic\ndrug, or psychotropic substance, or controlled\nsubstance in respect of which an offence punishable\nunder this Act has been committed or any document\nor other article which may furnish evidence of the\ncommission of such offence or any illegally acquired\nproperty or any document or other article which may\nfurnish evidence of holding any illegally acquired\nproperty which is liable for seizure or freezing or\nforfeiture under Chapter VA of this Act is kept or\nconcealed in any building, conveyance or enclosed\nplace, may between sunrise and sunset,\n(a) enter into and search any such building,\nconveyance\nor place;\n(b) in case of resistance, break open any door\nand remove any obstacle to such entry;\n\n12\n(c) seize such drug or substance and all\nmaterials used in the manufacture thereof and\nany other article and any animal or conveyance\nwhich he has reason to believe to be liable to\nconfiscation under this Act and any document or\nother article which he has reason to believe\nmay furnish evidence of the commission of any\noffence punishable under this Act or furnish\nevidence of holding any illegally acquired\nproperty which is liable for seizure or freezing or\nforfeiture under Chapter VA of this Act; and\n(d) detain and search, and, if he thinks proper,\narrest any person whom he has reason to\nbelieve to have committed any offence\npunishable under this Act:\nProvided that in respect of holder of a licence for\nmanufacture of manufactured drugs or psychotropic\nsubstances or controlled substances, granted under\nthis Act or any rule or order made thereunder, such\npower shall be exercised by an officer not below the\nrank of sub-inspector:\nProvided further that if such officer has reason to\nbelieve that a search warrant or authorisation cannot\nbe obtained without affording opportunity for the\nconcealment of evidence or facility for the escape of\nan offender, he may enter and search such building,\nconveyance or enclosed place at any time between\nsunset and sunrise after recording the grounds of his\nbelief.\n17. A careful perusal of the aforesaid provision would show that\nunder Section 42 only officers mentioned therein and so\nempowered officers can make the arrest or search as provided if\n\n13\nthey have reason to believe from personal knowledge or\ninformation qua offence(s). In both these provisions there are two\nimportant requirements. One is that the Magistrate or the officers\nmentioned therein firstly be empowered and they must have\nreason to believe that an offence under Chapter IV has been\ncommitted or that such arrest or search was necessary for other\npurposes mentioned in the provision. It has been held in\nparagraph 11 of State of Punjab v. Balbir Singh (1994) 3 SCC\n299 as under: -\n“11. But there are certain other embargoes envisaged\nunder Sections 41 and 42 of the NDPS Act. Only a\nMagistrate so empowered under Section 41 can issue\na warrant for arrest and search where he has reason\nto believe that an offence under Chapter IV has been\ncommitted so on and so forth as mentioned therein.\nUnder sub-section (2) only a Gazetted Officer or other\nofficers mentioned and empowered therein can give\nan authorization to a subordinate to arrest and search\nif such officer has reason to believe about the\ncommission of an offence and after reducing the\ninformation, if any, into writing. Under Section 42 only\nofficers mentioned therein and so empowered can\nmake the arrest or search as provided if they have\nreason to believe from personal knowledge or\ninformation. In both these provisions there are two\nimportant requirements. One is that the Magistrate or\nthe officers mentioned therein firstly be empowered\nand they must have reason to believe that an offence\nunder Chapter IV has been committed or that such\narrest or search was necessary for other purposes\nmentioned in the provision. So far as the first\n\n14\nrequirement is concerned, it can be seen that the\nLegislature intended that only certain Magistrates and\ncertain officers of higher rank and empowered can act\nto effect the arrest or search. This is a safeguard\nprovided having regard to the deterrent sentences\ncontemplated and with a view that innocent persons\nare not harassed. Therefore if an arrest or search\ncontemplated under these provisions of NDPS Act has\nto be carried out, the same can be done only by\ncompetent and empowered Magistrates or officers\nmentioned thereunder.”\nFurthermore, their Lordships in paragraph 14 have held that\nwhether there was such reason to believe and whether the officer\nempowered acted in a bona fide manner, depends upon the facts\nand circumstances of the case and will have a bearing in\nappreciation of the evidence.\n18. Even in Baldev Singh’s case (supra), their Lordships of the\nConstitution Bench of the Supreme Court with regard to Section\n42(1) of the NDPS Act have held in paragraphs 9 & 10 as under: -\n“9. Sub-section (1) of Section 42 lays down that the\nempowered officer, if has a prior information given by\nany person, he should necessarily take it down in\nwriting and where he has reason to believe from his\npersonal knowledge that offences under Chapter IV\nhave been committed or that materials which may\nfurnish evidence of commission of such offences are\nconcealed in any building etc. he may carry out the\narrest or search, without a warrant between sunrise\nand sunset, and he may do so without\nrecording his reasons of belief.\n\n15\n10. The proviso to sub-section (1) lays down that if the\nempowered officer has reason to believe that a search\nwarrant or authorisation cannot be obtained without\naffording opportunity for the concealment of evidence\nor facility for the escape of an offender, he may enter\nand search such building, conveyance or enclosed\nplace, at any time between sunset and sunrise, after\nrecording the grounds of his belief. Vide sub-section\n(2) of Section 42, the empowered officer who takes\ndown information in writing or records the grounds of\nhis belief under the proviso to sub-section (1), shall\nforthwith send a copy of the same to his immediate\nofficial superior. Section 43 deals with the power of\nseizure and arrest of the suspect in a public place. The\nmaterial difference between the provisions of Section\n43 and Section 42 is that whereas Section 42 requires\nrecording of reasons for belief and for taking down of\ninformation received in writing with regard to the\ncommission of an offence before conducting search\nand seizure, Section 43 does not contain any such\nprovision and as such while acting under Section 43 of\nthe Act, the empowered officer has the power of\nseizure of the article etc. and arrest of a person who is\nfound to be in possession of any narcotic drug or\npsychotropic substance in a public place where such\npossession appears to him to be unlawful.”\n19. Reverting to the facts of the case, in the instant case, it is\nundisputed that the investigation of the instant case was done by\nAmit Gupta, who was posted as Sub-Inspector of the Police\nStation, Ambikapur, District - Surguja on the date of incident, as\nsuch, we are of the considered view that he is entitled to proceed\nin the matters falls under the NDPS Act.\n\n16\n20. So far as submission of learned counsel for the appellant –\nNarayan Das in CRA No. 349 of 2021 that the provision of\nSection 50 of the NDPS Act has not been complied with as\nappellants-accused have not been apprised of their right to get\nsearched by the Gazetted Officer or by the Magistrate is\nconcerned, the Investigating Officer Amit Gupta (PW-7), in para-4\nof his examination-in-chief, has stated that the accused were\ngiven notice under Section 50 of the NDPS Act regarding their\nright and only upon their consent, they were searched by the\nPolice Officer. In para-19 of his cross-examination, this fact has\nbeen elicited by Investigating Officer-Amit Gupta, PW-7.\n21. So far as contention of the appellant – Ambika Vishwakarma in\nCRA No. 260 of 2021 that if the entire quantity of Codeine is\nexcluded from the total number of bottles seized, it would fall\nwithin the intermediate quantity, not the commercial quantity is\nconcerned. In support of said contention, reliance has been\nplaced in the matter of E.Micheal Raj (supra).\n22. While dealing with the reference not agreeing with the view taken\nin the case of E.Micheal Raj (supra), the Hon’ble Supreme Court\nin the matter of Hira Singh (supra) has observed as follows :\n“10. On merits whether any mixture of narcotic\ndrugs or psychotropic substances with one or more\nneutral substance(s) the quantity of neutral\nsubstance(s) is not to be taken into consideration or it is\nonly the actual content by weight of the offending drug\nwhich is relevant for the purpose of determining\nwhether it would constitute “small quantity or\ncommercial quantity”, the Statement of Objects and\n\n17\nReasons of NDPS Act is required to be considered. As\nper the preamble of NDPS Act, 1985, it is an Act to\nconsolidate and amend the law relating to Narcotic\nDrugs, to make stringent provisions for the control and\nregulation of operation relating to Narcotic Drugs and\nPsychotropic Substances. To provide for forfeiture of\nthe property derived from or use in illicit traffic in\nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substance. The\nStatement of objects and reasons and the preamble of\nthe NDPS Act imply that the Act is required to act as a\ndeterrent and the provisions must be stringent enough\nto ensure that the same Act as deterrents.\n10.1. In the case of Directorate of Enforcement vs.\nDeepak Mahajan and Another reported in (1994) 3 SCC\n440, it is observed by this Court that every law is\ndesigned to further ends of justice but not to frustrate\non the mere technicalities. It is further observed that\nthough the intention of the Court is only to expound the\nlaw and not to legislate, nonetheless the legislature\ncannot be asked to sit to resolve the difficulties in the\nimplementation of its intention and the spirit of the law.\nIt is the duty of the Court to mould or creatively interpret\nthe legislation by liberally interpreting the statute. In the\nsaid decision this Court has also quoted following\npassage in Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 10th\nEdition page 229:\n\"25. ….Where the language of a statute,\nin its ordinary meaning and grammatical\nconstruction, leads to a manifest contradiction\nof the apparent purpose of the enactment, or\nto some inconvenience or absurdity, hardship\nor injustice, presumably not intended, a\nconstruction may be put upon it which\nmodifies the meaning of the words, and even\nthe structure of the sentence. ... Where the\nmain object and intention of a statute are\nclear, it must not be reduced to a nullity by the\ndraftsman's unskilfulness or ignorance of the\nlaw, except in a case of necessity, or the\nabsolute intractability of the language used.\"\nThereafter, it is further observed that to winch up the\nlegislative intent, it is permissible for courts to take into\naccount the ostensible purpose and object and the real\n\n18\nlegislative intent. Otherwise, a bare mechanical\ninterpretation of the words and application of the\nlegislative intent devoid of concept of purpose and\nobject will render the legislature inane. It is further\nobserved that in given circumstances, it is permissible\nfor courts to have functional approaches and look into\nthe legislative intention and sometimes it may be even\nnecessary to go behind the words and enactment and\ntake other factors into consideration to give effect to the\nlegislative intention and to the purpose and spirit of the\nenactment so that no absurdity or practical\ninconvenience may result and the legislative exercise\nand its scope and object may not become futile.\n10.2 Therefore, considering the statement of\nobjects and reasons and the preamble of the NDPS Act\nand the relevant provisions of the NDPS Act, it seems\nthat it was never the intention of the legislature to\nexclude the quantity of neutral substance and to\nconsider only the actual content by weight of offending\ndrug which is relevant for the purpose of determining\nwhether it would constitute small quantity or commercial\nquantity. Right from sub-clause (viia) and (xxiiia) of\nSection 2 of NDPS Act emphasis is on Narcotic and\nDrug or Psychotropic Substance (Sections 21, 22, 23,\n24, 27 and 43). Even in the table attached to the\nNotification dated 19.10.2001, column no. 2 is with\nrespect to name of Narcotic Drug and Psychotropic\nSubstance and column nos. 5 and 6 are with respect to\n“small quantity and commercial quantity”. Note 2 of the\nNotification dated 19.10.2001 specifically provides that\nquantity shown against the respective drugs listed in\nthe table also apply to the preparations of the drug and\nthe preparations of substances of note 1. As per Note 1,\nthe small quantity and commercial quantity given\nagainst the respective drugs listed in the table apply to\nisomers ..., whenever existence of such substance is\npossible. Therefore, for the determination of “small\nquantity or the commercial quantity” with respect to\nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substance mentioned\nin column no.2 the quantity mentioned in the clauses 5\nand 6 are required to be taken into consideration.\nHowever, in the case of mixture of the narcotic drugs /\npsychotropic drugs mentioned in column no.2 and any\nmixture or preparation that of with or without the neutral\n\n19\nmaterial of any of the drugs mentioned in table, lesser\nof the small quantity between the quantities given\nagainst the respective Narcotic Drugs or Psychotropic\nSubstances forming part of mixture and lesser of\ncommercial quantity between the quantities given\nagainst the respective narcotic drugs or psychotropic\nsubstance forming part of the mixture is to be taken into\nconsideration. As per example, mixture of 100 gm is\nseized and the mixture is consisting of two different\nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substance with\nneutral material, one drug is heroin and another is\nmethadone, lesser of commercial quantity between the\nquantities given against the aforesaid two respective\nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substance is required\nto be considered. For the purpose of determination of\nthe “small quantity or commercial quantity”, in case of\nentry 239 the entire weight of the mixture / drug by\nwhatever named called weight of neutral material is\nalso required to be considered subject to what is stated\nhereinabove. If the view taken by this Court in the case\nof E. Micheal Raj (Supra) is accepted , in that case , it\nwould be adding something to the relevant provisions of\nthe statute which is not there and/or it was never\nintended by the legislature.\n8.3 At this stage, it is required to be noted that illicit\ndrugs are seldom sold in a pure form. They are almost\nalways adulterated or cut with other substance.\nCaffeine is mixed with heroin, it causes that heroin to\nvaporize at a lower rate. That could allow users to take\nthe drug faster and get a big punch sooner. Aspirin,\ncrushed tablets, they could have enough powder to\namend reversal doses of drugs. Take example of\nheroin. It is known as powerful and illegal street drug\nand opiate derived from morphine. This drug can easily\nbe “cut” with a variety of different substances. This\nmeans that drug dealer will add other drugs or non -\nintoxicating substances to the drug so that they can sell\nmore of it at a lesser expense to themselves. Brown-\nsugar / smack is usually made available in power form.\nThe substances is only about 20% heroin. The heroin is\nmixed with other substances like chalk powder, zinc\noxide, because of these, impurities in the drug, brown-\nsugar is cheaper but more dangerous. These are only\nfew examples to show and demonstrate that even\n\n20\nmixture of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substance is\nmore dangerous. Therefore, what is harmful or injurious\nis the entire mixture/tablets with neutral substance and\nNarcotic Drugs or Psychotropic Substances. Therefore,\nif it is accepted that it is only the actual content by\nweight of offending drug which is relevant for the\npurpose of determining whether it would constitute\nsmall quantity or commercial quantity , in that case , the\nobject and purpose of enactment of NDPS Act would be\nfrustrated. There may be few punishment for\n“commercial quantity”. Certainly that would not have\nbeen the intention of the legislature.\n10.4. Even considering the definition of\n“manufacture”, “manufactured drug” and the\n“preparation” conjointly, the total weight of such\n“manufactured drug” or “preparation”, including the\nneutral material is required to be considered while\ndetermining small quantity or commercial quantity. If it\nis interpreted in such a manner, then and then only, the\nobjects and purpose of NDPS Act would be achieved.\nAny other intention to defeat the object and purpose of\nenactment of NDPS Act viz. to Act is deterrent.\n10.5. The problem of drug addicts is international\nand the mafia is working throughout the world. It is a\ncrime against the society and it has to be dealt with iron\nhands. Use of drugs by the young people in India has\nincreased. The drugs are being used for weakening of\nthe nation. During the British regime control was kept\non the traffic of dangerous drugs by enforcing the\nOpium Act, 1857. The Opium Act, 1875 and the Dangerous\nDrugs Act, 1930. However, with the passage of time\nand the development in the field of illicit drug traffic and\nduring abuse at national and international level, many\ndeficiencies in the existing laws have come to notice.\nTherefore, in order to remove such deficiencies and\ndifficulties, there was urgent need for the enactment of\na comprehensive legislation on Narcotic Drugs and\nPsychotropic Substances, which led to enactment of\nNDPS Act. As observed herein above, the Act is a special\nlaw and has a laudable purpose to serve and is\nintended to combat the menace otherwise bent upon\ndestroying the public health and national health. The\nguilty must be in and the innocent ones must be out.\n\n21\nThe punishment part in drug trafficking is an important\none but its preventive part is more important. Therefore,\nprevention of illicit traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic\nSubstances Act, 1988 came to be introduced. The aim was\nto prevent illicit traffic rather than punish after the\noffence was committed. Therefore, the Courts will have\nto safeguard the life and liberty of the innocent persons.\nTherefore, the provisions of NDPS Act are required to\nbe interpreted keeping in mind the object and purpose\nof NDPS Act; impact on the society as a whole and the\nAct is required to be interpreted literally and not liberally\nwhich may ultimately frustrate the object, purpose and\npreamble of the Act. Therefore, the interpretation of the\nrelevant provisions of the statute canvassed on behalf\nof the accused and the intervener that quantity of\nneutral substance (s) is not to be taken into\nconsideration and it is only actual content of the weight\nof the offending drug, which is relevant for the purpose\nof determining whether it would constitute “small\nquantity or commercial quantity”, cannot be accepted.”\n23. Reverting to the facts of the present case, on search of suspect\nAmbika Vishwkarma, a cement colour trolley bag with Flyte King\ncompany's monochrome was found in his possession, which was\nopened and searched. R.C. KUFF COUGH SYRUP total 143\npieces, each containing 100 ml was found in it and a backpack in\npossession of second suspect Narayan Das which was blackish\nlight sky blue in colour and of the company TYCOON was\nopened and searched which contained CODECTUS COUGH\nSYRUP 70 pieces, each containing 100 ml and ELDER QREX\nCOUGH SYRUP 23 pieces, each of 100 ml in vials with labels\ncontaining a substance called Codeine Phosphate which was a\nnarcotic drug, due to which search panchnama Ex.P-11 of the\nsuspects was prepared. Thus, in the light of Judgment of\nHon’ble Supreme Court in the Case of Hira Singh (supra), we\n\n22\nare of the considered opinion that the quantity so seized from the\npossession of the accused/ appellants would fall under the\ncategory of commercial quantity.\n24. Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case\nand the submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the\nparties, material available on record and also considering the\nevidence of Investigating Officer Amit Gupta (PW-7) and in the\nlight of Judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in the Case of Hira\nSingh (supra), we are of the considered opinion that the\nprosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.\n25. The last contention that has been raised on behalf of the\nappellants is that without assigning any special reason, the\nlearned trial Court has awarded sentence for a period of 12 years\nto the appellants, which is more than the minimum sentence\nprescribed for offence under Section 21(c) of the NDPS Act.\n26. Section 32B of the NDPS Act states about the facts to be taken\ninto account for imposing higher than the minimum punishment,\nwhich reads as under:\n“Where a minimum term of imprisonment or amount\nof fine is prescribed for any offence committed under\nthis Act, the court may, in addition to such factors as\nit may deem fit, take into account the following\nfactors for imposing a punishment higher than the\nminimum term of imprisonment or amount of fine,\nnamely:--\n(a) the use or threat of use of violence or arms by\nthe offender;\n\n23\n(b) the fact that the offender holds a public office and\nthat he has taken advantage of that office in\ncommitting the offence;\n(c) the fact that the minors are affected by the\noffence or the minors are used for the commission of\nan offence;\n(d) the fact that the offence is committed in an\neducational institution or social service facility or in\nthe immediate vicinity of such institution or faculty or\nin other place to which school children and students\nresort for educational, sports and social activities.;\n(e) the fact that the offender belongs to organised\ninternational or any other criminal group which is\ninvolved in the commission of the offences; and\n(f) the fact that the offender is involved in other\nillegal activities facilitated by commission of the\noffence.”\n27. The Supreme Court in the matter of Rafiq Qureshi (supra) has\nheld that in a case where the court imposes a punishment higher\nthan minimum relying on an irrelevant factor and no other facts as\nenumerated in Sections 32B(a) to (f) is present, award of\nsentence higher than minimum can be interfere with and\nobserved in Para-23 & 24 as under:\n“23. In view of the foregoing discussion, we are of\nthe view that punishment awarded by the trial court\nof a sentence higher than the minimum relying on\nthe quantity of substance cannot be faulted even\nthough the Court had not adverted to the factors\nmentioned in clauses (a) to (b) as enumerated under\nSection 32B. However, when taking any factor into\nconsideration other than the factors enumerated in\nSection 32B, (a) to (f), the Court imposes a\npunishment higher than the minimum sentence, it\ncan be examined by higher Courts as to whether\nfactor taken into consideration by the Court is a\nrelevant factor or not. Thus in a case where Court\nimposes a punishment higher than minimum relying\non a irrelevant factor and no other factor as\n\n24\nenumerated in Section 32B(a to f) are present award\nof sentence higher than minimum can be interfered\nwith.\n24. In the present case The High Court held that\nalthough gross quantity of 8.175 Kg. of Heroin was\nalleged to have been recovered from the appellant\nbut actual quantity of Heroine which was found to be\nin possession was only 609.6 gm. The High Court\nheld that since the appellant was found in\npossession of Narcotic Drugs as per the analysis\nreport to 609.6 gm. which is much higher than the\ncommercial quantity, punishment higher than the\nminimum is justified. The High Court reduced the\npunishment from 18 years to 16 years. We, thus,\nuphold the judgment of the trial court and the High\nCourt awarding the punishment higher than the\nminimum, however, looking to all the facts and\ncircumstances of the present case including the fact\nthat it was found by the High Court that the appellant\nwas only a carrier, we find that the ends of justice\nwill be sub-served in reducing the sentence from 16\nyears to 12 years. Thus, while maintaining the\nconviction of the appellant the appellant is\nsentenced to undergo 12 years rigorous\nimprisonment with fine of Rs. 2 lakh and in default of\npayment of such fine the appellant shall further\nundergo for a simple imprisonment for six months.\nThe appeal is partly allowed to the extent as\nindicated above. ”\n28. As such, in view of discussion made hereinabove, in light of\nSection 32B of the NDPS Act coupled with above-quoted\nprinciple of law laid down in Rafiq Qureshi (supra), since no\nspecific or any special reason has been assigned by the learned\ntrial Court for awarding sentence higher than minimum to the\nappellants for having committed offence under Section 21(c) of\nthe NDPS Act, in the considered opinion of this Court, while\naffirming the conviction of the appellants for offence under\n\n25\nSection 20(c) of the NDPS Act, we deem it appropriate to reduce\nhis sentence of 12 years rigorous imprisonment, as awarded to\nthem by the learned trial Court, to 10 years rigorous\nimprisonment. So far as the default sentence is concerned, the\nsame is modified to the extent that in case of failure to deposit the\nfine amount awarded by the trial Court, the appellants shall\nundergo further rigorous imprisonment for one year instead of\nthree years, as awarded by trial Court. It is ordered accordingly.\n29. Consequently, both the criminal appeals are partly allowed to\nthe extent indicated hereinabove. It is stated that the appellants\nare in jail, they shall serve out the remaining sentence as\nmodified by this Court.\n30. Registry is directed to send a certified copy of this judgment along\nwith the original record of the case to the trial court concerned\nforthwith for necessary information and compliance and also send\na copy of this judgment to the concerned Superintendent of Jail\nwhere the appellants are undergoing their jail sentence to serve\nthe same on the appellants informing them that they are at liberty\nto assail the present judgment passed by this Court by preferring\nan appeal before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, if so advised, with\nthe assistance of High Court Legal Services Committee or the\nSupreme Court Legal Services Committee.\nSd/- Sd/-\n(Ravindra Kumar Agrawal) (Ramesh Sinha)\nJudge Chief Justice\nChandra\n\n26\nHead – Note\nWhile considering the mixture of narcotic drugs or psychotropic\nsubstance for the purpose of determining whether it would constitute\n“small quantity or commercial quantity”, not only the quantity of ‘offending\ndrug’ but the quantity of ‘neutral substance’ mixed should also be taken\ninto consideration.",
