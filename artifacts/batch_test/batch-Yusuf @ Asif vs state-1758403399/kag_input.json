No. 3010 of 2023]\nYUSUF @ ASIF …APPELLANT\nVERSUS\nSTATE …RESPONDENT\nJ U D G M E N T\nPANKAJ MITHAL, J.\n1. Leave granted.\n2. Heard Mr. Narendra Hooda, learned Senior counsel for the\nappellant and Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, learned Additional\nSolicitor General for the respondent.\n1 | 10\n\n3. On the basis of the information received by the Intelligence\nOfficer of Narcotics Control Bureau1, a lorry parked near\nPuzhal Central Jail, Chennai, was intercepted by NCB on\n28.03.2000 early in the morning. Four persons were found in\nthe lorry and upon search, they were found in possession of\ncommercial quantity i.e. 20 kgs of heroin kept in two jute\nbags. The samples were drawn from each of the packets i.e. 14\nbig and 12 small polythene packets kept in the two jute bags\nand they were seized under a seizure memo i.e. Mahazar. All\nthe four persons were arrested after receiving the analyst\nreport that the seized substance was nothing else but heroin.\n4. Consequently, the case crime No.113/2000 was registered.\nThe trial court upon consideration of the evidence on record\nheld all the four persons guilty under the provisions of the\nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 19852 and\nconvicted them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years\nand to pay fine of Rs.1 lakh each, in default of which a further\nimprisonment of one year was ordered.\n1 hereinafter referred to as “NCB”\n2 hereinafter referred to as “NDPS Act”\n2 | 10\n\n5. All the four accused persons preferred appeal before the High\nCourt. During the pendency of the appeal, A­4 (Ganesh Ram)\ndied and the appeal was dismissed as abated against him vide\norder dated 15.07.2022. The High Court vide judgment and or­\nder dated 11.10.2022 dismissed the appeal holding that there\nis no error in the findings recorded by the trial court and,\ntherefore, the accused persons were directed to serve the re­\nmaining sentence after adjusting the period of imprisonment\nalready undergone.\n6. Aggrieved by his conviction and sentencing by the trial court\nand its affirmation by the High Court, A­1 alone has preferred\nthe present appeal assailing the judgment and order of the\nHigh Court dated 11.10.2022.\n7. It may be relevant to mention here that A­1 is the owner of the\ncontraband and the same was being transported from Madhya\nPradesh to Chennai with the help of A­2 to A­4. A­1 had\nreached the place of seizure of the contraband to receive it,\nonce it had reached Chennai.\n3 | 10\n\n8. We have heard learned Senior counsel for the appellant. The\nmain plank of his argument is that the entire action of seizure\nand sampling is wholly illegal. It was done in violation of the\nmandatory provisions of Section 52A (2) of the NDPS Act as\nthe procedure prescribed therein was not followed in drawing\nthe samples and seizing the alleged narcotic substance. Fur­\nther, there is a serious doubt about the correctness of samples\nsent for analysis as to whether they were actually the samples\nof the seized contraband.\n9. Learned counsel for the respondent on behalf of the State\nsubmitted that the search and seizure was based upon the\nprior information received by the Intelligence Officer of NCB\nwho has been examined as PW1. The accused persons were\ndisclosed the identity of the officers and after obtaining their\nconsent in writing, the search was carried out in the presence\nof Superintendent of Police, NCB (PW8) who was a gazetted\nofficer. After seizure, two samples from each packet were\ndrawn and packed separately and were sealed. The NCB seal\nNo.12 was affixed to it and the correct seal number was\n4 | 10\n\nmentioned in the Mahazar and all other documents except in\nthe godown receipt whereby inadvertently seal No.11 was\nmentioned. The Officers involved in the search, seizure and\narrest operation had duly submitted their report as referred to\nunder Section 57 of the NDPS Act.\n10. In order to test the above submissions, it would be relevant to\nrefer to the provisions of Section 52A (2), (3) and (4) of the\nNDPS Act. The aforesaid provisions provide for the procedure\nand manner of seizing, preparing the inventory of the seized\nmaterial, forwarding the seized material and getting inventory\ncertified by the Magistrate concerned. It is further provided\nthat the inventory or the photographs of the seized substance\nand any list of the samples in connection thereof on being cer­\ntified by the Magistrate shall be recognized as the primary evi­\ndence in connection with the offences alleged under the NDPS\nAct.\n11. For the sake of convenience, relevant sub­sections of Section\n52A of the NDPS Act are reproduced hereinbelow:\n5 | 10\n\n“52A. Disposal of seized narcotic drugs and\npsychotropic substances.­\n(1) ­­­­­­­­­\n(2) Where any [narcotic drugs, psychotropic\nsubstances, controlled substances or\nconveyances] has been seized and forwarded to\nthe officer­in­charge of the nearest police station\nor to the officer empowered under section 53, the\nofficer referred to in sub­section (1) shall prepare\nan inventory of such [narcotic drugs,\npsychotropic substances, controlled substances\nor conveyances] containing such details relating\nto their description, quality, quantity, mode of\npacking, marks, numbers or such other\nidentifying particulars of the [narcotic drugs,\npsychotropic substances, controlled substances\nor conveyances] or the packing in which they are\npacked, country of origin and other particulars\nas the officer referred to in sub­section (1) may\nconsider relevant to the identity of the [narcotic\ndrugs, psychotropic substances, controlled\nsubstances or conveyances] in any proceedings\nunder this Act and make an application, to any\nMagistrate for the purpose of­\n(a) certifying the correctness of the inventory\nso prepared; or\n6 | 10\n\n(b) taking, in the presence of such Magistrate,\nphotographs of [such drugs or substances or\nconveyances] and certifying such\nphotographs as true; or\n(c) allowing to draw representative samples of\nsuch drugs or substances, in the presence of\nsuch Magistrate and certifying the\ncorrectness of any list of samples so drawn.\n(3) Where an application is made under sub­\nsection (2), the Magistrate shall, as soon as may\nbe, allow the application.\n(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in the\nIndian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872) or the\nCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974),\nevery court trying an offence under this Act, shall\ntreat the inventory, the photographs of [narcotic\ndrugs, psychotropic substances, controlled\nsubstances or conveyances] and any list of\nsamples drawn under sub­section (2) and\ncertified by the Magistrate, as primary evidence\nin respect of such offence.”\n12. A simple reading of the aforesaid provisions, as also stated\nearlier, reveals that when any contraband/narcotic substance\nis seized and forwarded to the police or to the officer so\nmentioned under Section 53, the officer so referred to in sub­\n7 | 10\n\nsection (1) shall prepare its inventory with details and the\ndescription of the seized substance like quality, quantity,\nmode of packing, numbering and identifying marks and then\nmake an application to any Magistrate for the purposes of\ncertifying its correctness and for allowing to draw\nrepresentative samples of such substances in the presence of\nthe Magistrate and to certify the correctness of the list of\nsamples so drawn.\n13. Notwithstanding the defence set up from the side of the\nrespondent in the instant case, no evidence has been brought\non record to the effect that the procedure prescribed under\nsub­sections (2), (3) and (4) of Section 52A of the NDPS Act\nwas followed while making the seizure and drawing sample\nsuch as preparing the inventory and getting it certified by the\nMagistrate. No evidence has also been brought on record that\nthe samples were drawn in the presence of the Magistrate and\nthe list of the samples so drawn were certified by the\nMagistrate. The mere fact that the samples were drawn in the\n8 | 10\n\npresence of a gazetted officer is not sufficient compliance of\nthe mandate of sub­section (2) of Section 52A of the NDPS Act.\n14. It is an admitted position on record that the samples from the\nseized substance were drawn by the police in the presence of\nthe gazetted officer and not in the presence of the Magistrate.\nThere is no material on record to prove that the Magistrate\nhad certified the inventory of the substance seized or of the list\nof samples so drawn.\n15. In Mohanlal’s3 case, the apex court while dealing with Section\n52A of the NDPS Act clearly laid down that it is manifest from\nthe said provision that upon seizure of the contraband, it has\nto be forwarded either to the officer­in­charge of the nearest\npolice station or to the officer empowered under Section 53\nwho is obliged to prepare an inventory of the seized\ncontraband and then to make an application to the Magistrate\nfor the purposes of getting its correctness certified. It has been\nfurther laid down that the samples drawn in the presence of\nthe Magistrate and the list thereof on being certified alone\n3 Union of India vs Mohanlal and Anr(2016) 3 SCC 379\n9 | 10\n\nwould constitute primary evidence for the purposes of the\ntrial.\n16. In the absence of any material on record to establish that the\nsamples of the seized contraband were drawn in the presence\nof the Magistrate and that the inventory of the seized\ncontraband was duly certified by the Magistrate, it is apparent\nthat the said seized contraband and the samples drawn\ntherefrom would not be a valid piece of primary evidence in the\ntrial. Once there is no primary evidence available, the trial as a\nwhole stands vitiated.\n17. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the failure of the\nconcerned authorities to lead primary evidence vitiates the\nconviction and as such in our opinion, the conviction of the\nappellant deserves to be set aside. The impugned judgment\nand order of the High Court as well as the trial court\nconvicting the appellant and sentencing him to rigorous\nimprisonment of 10 years with fine of Rs.1 lakh and in default\nof payment of fine to undergo further imprisonment of one\nyear is hereby set aside.\n10 | 10\n\n18. The appellant has already undergone more than 6 years of\nimprisonment out of 10 years awarded to him. He is on bail\nand has been granted exemption from surrender by this\nCourt. Therefore, his bail bonds, if any, stands cancelled.\n19. The appeal is allowed with no order as to costs.\n……………………….. J.\n(ABHAY S. OKA)\n………………………..
