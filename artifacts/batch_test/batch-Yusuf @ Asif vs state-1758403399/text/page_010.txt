would constitute primary evidence for the purposes of the
trial.
16. In the absence of any material on record to establish that the
samples of the seized contraband were drawn in the presence
of the Magistrate and that the inventory of the seized
contraband was duly certified by the Magistrate, it is apparent
that the said seized contraband and the samples drawn
therefrom would not be a valid piece of primary evidence in the
trial. Once there is no primary evidence available, the trial as a
whole stands vitiated.
17. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the failure of the
concerned authorities to lead primary evidence vitiates the
conviction and as such in our opinion, the conviction of the
appellant deserves to be set aside. The impugned judgment
and order of the High Court as well as the trial court
convicting the appellant and sentencing him to rigorous
imprisonment of 10 years with fine of Rs.1 lakh and in default
of payment of fine to undergo further imprisonment of one
year is hereby set aside.
