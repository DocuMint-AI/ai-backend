Ltd.\nWebsite : www.courtkutchehry.com\nPrinted For :\nDate : 24/08/2025\nState Vs Veerappan and Others\nCourt: Madras High Court\nDate of Decision: March 24, 1980\nActs Referred: Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (CrPC) â€” Section 255(1)\nMadras Prohibition Act, 1937 â€” Section 4(1)(b)\nCitation: (1980) LW(Cri) 187\nHon'ble Judges: Rataare Pandian, J; Paul, J; Natarajan, J\nBench: Full Bench\nAdvocate: P. Rajamanickam, P.P, for the Appellant; K. Doraiswami for Respts, Mr. M.S. Menon for Bar Association\nand Mr. K.V. Sankaran for Advocates Association, for the Respondent\nJudgement\nPaul J.\n1. These appeals which have been preferred by the State represented by the learned Public Prosecutor against the\norders of the learned Judicial\nSecond Class Magistrate of Namakkal acquitting the respondent-accused in each case of an offence punishable under\nS. 4(1)(b) of the Tamil\nNadu Prohibition Act are before us, in as much as on a reference by one of us, before whom the appeals originally\ncame up for hearing, the matter\nhas been placed before this Full Bench since the matter involved a question of law of public importance, in regard to\nwhich question of law there\nhave been divergent views of various High Courts.\n2. Of the two questions which have been referred to this Full Bench, the first one, namely, whether under S. 255(1), Crl.\nP.C., a Magistrate can\nacquit the accused if the prosecution fails to apply for the issue of summons to any witness and does not produce the\nwitness for several hearings\nand does not serve summons on the. witnesses despite having been granted sufficient opportunity to serve the\nsummons or to produce the\nwitnesses, is the one that directly arises for determination in these appeals. The second question which arises for\ndetermination by us incidentally is\nwhether a Magistrate can acquit the accused under S. 245(1), Crl. P.C., if the prosecution does not apply for the issue\nof summons to any of the\nwitnesses and does not produce the witness for several hearings and does not serve the summons on the witnesses\ndespite having been granted\nsufficient opportunities to serve the summons on the witnesses or to produce the witnesses.\n\n3. In all these appeals, the learned Magistrate acquitted the accused under S. 255(I), Crl. P.C., on the ground that even\nthough the cases had been\nposted for hearing on various dates and summons had been issued to the witnesses for all the hearings, the witnesses\nwere not produced on any of\nthe hearing dates and in spite of a notice issued that the case would be disposed of without examining the witnesses if\nthey are not produced the\nprosecution did not choose to let in any evidence and as such the Magistrate found that the prosecution had no\nevidence to let in.\n4. S. 81, Crl. P.C. 1861, (sic) the Magistrate to issue a warrant. We shall first examine the provisions of the Crl. P.C. of\n1973, which have\nrelevance to this matter. S. 255(1), Crl. P.C. under which the accused have been acquitted in these cases states as\nfollows-\nIf the Magistrate, upon taking the evidence referred to in S. 254 and such further evidence, if any, as he may, of his own\nmotion, cause to be\nproduced, finds the accused not guilty, he shall record an order of acquittal.\nS. 254, Crl. P.C. states as follows-\n(1) If the Magistrate does not convict the accused under S. 255 or S. 253, the Magistrate shall proceed to hear the\nprosecution and take all such\nevidence as may be produced in support of the prosecution, and also to hear the accused and take all such evidence\nas he produces in his defence.\n(2) The Magistrate may; if he thinks fit, on the application of the prosecution or the accused issue a summons to any\nwitness directing him to attend\nor to produce any document or other thing.\n(3) The Magistrate may, before summoning any witness on such application, require that the reasonable expenses of\nthe witness incurred in\nattending for the purposes of the trial be deposited In Court.\nIt will be noticed that under Sub-s. (1) of S. 254, the Magistrate is enjoined to hear the prosecution and take all such\nevidence as may be\nproduced in support of prosecution and also to hear the accused and take all such evidence as he produces in hit\ndefence, It was to be noted that\nunder that sub-section a duty is cast on the prosecution to produce its evidence and likewise on the accused to produce\nevidence in his defence.\nSub-S. (2) of S. 254 makes provision for the prosecution of the accused to seek the assistance of the Court in\nproducing its or his evidence by\napplying for issue of summons to any witness directing him to attend or to produce any document or other thing. It may\nalso be noted that this sub-\nsection gives a discretion to the Magistrate to so issue summons on the application of the prosecution or the accused\nby using the words ''the\nMagistrate may, if he thinks fit. Thus an emphasis is placed by S. 254 on the duty of the prosecution or the accused to\nproduce all evidence in\n\nsupport of its case or his defence:\n5. S. 255(1) makes provision for the Magistrate upon taking the evidence referred to in S. 254 to take such further\nevidence, if any, as he may of\nhis own motion cause to be produced. Under S. 255(1) a Magistrate can record an order of acquittal if he finds the\naccused not guilty upon taking\nthe evidence learned to in S. 254 and such further evidence, if any, as he may, of his own motion, cause to be\nproduced. S. 244, Crl. P. C. of\n1898 (corresponding to S. 254 of the Code of 1973), as it was in force before the Criminal Procedure Code of 1973\ncame Into effect also\ncontained similar provisions. S. 258, Crl, P. C, 1973, which is analogous to S. 249 of the Crl. P. C. of 1898, reads as\nfollows :-\nIn any summons case instituted otherwise than upon complaint, a Magistrate of the first class or, with the previous\nsanction of the Chief Judicial\nMagistrate, any other Judicial Magistrate, may, for reasons to be recorded by him, stop the proceedings at any stage\nwithout pronouncing any\njudgment and such stoppage of proceedings is made after the evidence of the principal witnesses has been recorded\npronounce a judgment of\nacquittal, and In any other case, release the accused and such release shall have the effect of discharge.\nIn all the cases now before us, the Magistrate could have very well resorted to this section But instead he has acquitted\nthe accused under S.\n255(1), Crl. P. C. and it is this acquittal which has been challenged by the State in these appeals on the ground that the\nMagistrate cannot acquit\nthe accused under S. 255(1), Crl. P. C. when he has not taken the evidence referred to in S. 254, Crl. P. C.\n6. We shall also now examine the provisions relating to the trial of warrant cases instituted on a police report. We might\nnote here that the cases\nnow before us are summons cases but in order to answer the question No, 2, referred to us in the reference it is\nnecessary to examine the position\nregarding the trial of warrant cases instituted on a police report, for, those provisions also help to throw light on the first\nquestion which has been\nreferred to us and which relates to summons cases. Under S. 240 if upon consideration of the Police report and the\ndocuments sent with it under\nS. 173, and examination of the accused, if any, as the Magistrate thinks necessary and after giving the prosecution and\nthe accused an opportunity\nof being heard. the Magistrate is of opinion that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an\noffence tribal under Chapter 19\nwhich such Magistrate is competent to try and which in his opinion could be adequately punished by him, he shall frame\nin writing a charge against\nthe accused. Under S. 242, Crl. P. C. if the accused refuses to plead or does not plead or claims to be tried or the\nMagistrate does not convict the\n\naccused under S. 241, on his plea of guilt the Magistrate should fix a date for examination of the witnesses and the\nMagistrate may on the\napplication of the prosecution issue summons to any of its witnesses directing him to attend or to produce any\ndocument or other thing and on the\ndate so fixed the Magistrate shall proceed to take all such evidence as may be produced In support of the prosecution.\nS. 243 states that the\naccused shall then be called upon to enter up.-m his defence and produce his evidence, and if the accused puts in any\nwritten statement, the\nMagistrate shall file it with the record, and if the accused after he Has entered upon his defence, applies to the\nMagistrate to issue any process for\ncompelling the attendance of any witness for the purpose of examination or cross-examination or the production of the\ndocument or other things,\nthe Magistrate shall issue such process unless he considers that such application should be refused on the ground that\nit is made for the purpose of\nvexation or delay or for defeating the ends of justice and such grounds shall be recorded by him in writing. It might be\nnoted that as In S. 254, Crl.\nP.C. relating to the trial of-summons cases, the Magistrate even in warrant cases instituted on a police reports enjoined\nunder Sub-s. (3) of S. 242\nto take all such evidence as may be produced in support of the prosecution and a provision has been made in Sub-s.\n(2) of S. 242, for the issue of\nsummons to any witness directing him to attend or produce any document or other thing on the application of the\nprosecution. It may, however, be\nnoted that while under S. 254(2) the Magistrate '' may if he thinks if issue such summons, under S. 242, the Magistrate\n''may'' issue, such summons\nApparently, the words ''if he thinks fit'' have been included in S. 254(2) in summons cases in order to give the\nMagistrate the power to refuse to\nissue such summons if he thinks it proper to do so. The words ''if he thinks fit'' in Sub-s. (2) of S. 254, further indicate\nthat the Magistrate has to\napply his mind when an application is made by the prosecution or the accused to issue such summons. Therefore, even\nin regard to warrant cases\ninstituted on police report, a duty is cast on the Magistrate to take all evidence that may be produced by the prosecution\nas well as a duty to\nfacilitate the production of evidence, by the prosecution, by issuing summons to witnesses on the application of the\nprosecution, and likewise, a\nduty has also been cast on the prosecution to produce all evidence in support of its case. Since both in S. 254(1) as\nwell as in S. 242(3), the\nwords ''as may be produced in support of the prosecution'' have been used it is necessary for us to examine the\nconnotation of the words ''as\nmaybe produced''.\n7. In State of Orissa Vs. Sib Charan Singh, it has been observed as follows: (Head note):-\n\nThe word ''produced'' in Sub-s. (7) of S. 251(a) Crl. P. C. 1898 and analogous, to S. 242(3) cannot be given any\nrestricted meaning as to saddle\nthe prosecution '' with the entire responsibility of producing the evidence A duty also is cast upon the courts for\nenforcing attendance of witnesses\nby the process provided in the Crl. P.C. The courts are not therefore, absolutely powerless when the parties fail to\nproduce evidence relevant In a\ncase.\nIn State v. Mandkishore, A.I.R 1967 Raj. 228 it has been observed is follows (Head note)-; J.\nThe word ''produce'' in Sub-s. (7) Includes the bringing forward of the witnesses by the prosecution at its own instance\nor through the process of\nthe Court whom it desires to examine at trial. Besides, in the administration of Criminal Justice a duty is cast upon the\ncourt to arrive at the truth by\nall lawful means though the primary responsibility of prosecuting cognizable offence is on the executive authorities.\nWe are in respectful agreement with the aforesaid observations of the Orissa and the Rajasthan High Courts. The\nRajasthan High Court went on to\npoint out that the Magistrate should not feel himself helpless in such situations and should exercise his inherent powers\nunder S. 540 to summon\nsuch witnesses as he thinks necessary for the ends of justice. If the prosecution by its negligence or otherwise fails to\ndischarge its responsibility in\nproducing witnesses, it is incumbent on the court to examine such witnesses as it considers necessary in the ends of\njustice.\n8. S. 510, Crl. P.C. 1898, state as follows-\nAny Court may at any stage of enquiry, trial o other proceeding under this Code summon any person as a witness or\nexamine any person in\nattendance, though not summoned as a witness'' or recall and reexamine any person already examined and the court\nshall summon and examine or\nrecall and examine any such person if his evidence appears to it essential to the just decision of the case.\nThe analogous and corresponding provision in the present Crl. P.C. is S. 311. Thus the court cannot absolve itself of its\nresponsibility to summon\nand examine all witnesses whose evidence appears to it to be essential to a just decision of the case, merely because\nthe prosecution does not\nproduce such witnesses owing to its negligence or otherwise. It being clear that it is the duty of the Magistrate to issue\nsummons and secure the\npresence of witnesses and examine them, when the prosecution seeks the court''s assistance by means of an\napplication, the Court is further\nobliged in discharge of its duty to arrive at the truth by all lawful means in furtherance of the administration of criminal\njustice the suo motu take all\nsteps to secure the presence of witnesses where evidence appears to it to be essential to a just decision of the case.\n9. We shall now proceed to indicate the powers which the Magistrate could exercise and the steps he could take under\nthe Crl. P.C. in the matter\n\nof securing the presence of witnesses, S. 62, Crl. P. C. reads as follows:--\n(1) Every summons shall be served by a police officer or subject to such rules as the State Government may make in\nthis behalf, by an officer of\nthe court issuing it or other public servant.\nS. 64 states \"\"Where the persons summoned cannot by the exercise of due diligence be found, the summons may be\nserved by leaving one of the\nduplicates for him with some adult male member of his family residing with him and the person with whom the\nsummons is so left, shall, if so\nrequired by the serving officer sign a receipt therefore on the back of the other duplicate,\"\" S. 65, Crl. P.C. states:-\nIf service cannot by the exercise of due diligence be effected as provided in S62, S. 63 or S. 64, the serving officer shall\naffix one of the duplicates\nof the summons to some conspicuous part of the house or homestead in which the person summoned ordinarily resides\nand thereupon the court,\nafter making such enquiries as it thinks fit may either declare that the summons has been duly served or order fresh\nservice in such manner as it\nconsiders proper.\nS. 69 which makes provision for service of summons on witnesses by post reads as follows:-\n(l) Notwithstanding anything contained in the preceding sections of this Chapter, a court issuing a summons to a\nwitness may, in addition to and\nsimultaneously with the issue of fresh summons direct a copy of the summons to be served by registered post\naddressed to the witness at the place\nwhere he ordinarily resides or carries on business or personally works for gain.\n(2) Where an acknowledgment purporting to be signed by the witness or an endorsement purporting to be made by a\npostal employee that the\nwitness refused to take delivery of the summons has been received the court issuing the summons may declare that\nthe summons has been duly\nserved.\nThis provision is a new one incorporated in the Crl. P.C. of 1973, and was not in the old Crl. P. C. This provision, in our\nexperience, has not been\nresorted to by any Magistrate as far as we know. Of course, it is not practicable to adopt this procedure in every case,\nfor, it would result in heavy\nexpenditure to the State. Nevertheless, where summons issued has not been served on the witnesses by a police\nofficer under S. 62, repeatedly,\nthe Magistrate may resort to this provision of issuing the summons and sending it by registered post to the witness. Of\ncourse, if after due service,\nthe witness does not appear before the Court, the Court should be coercive processes for securing the pretence of the\nwitness before the Court.\nID suitable cases, or in cases of chronic or persistent failure to appear in response to the summons, a complaint can be\nlaid under S. 174, I.P.C.\n\nThen again, the Explanation (2) in S. 309, Crl. P.C. also can be made use of in suitable cases by the Magistrate, for,''\nthat Explanation states ''the\nterms on which an adjournment or postponement may be granted including in appropriate cases; the payment of costs\nby the prosecution or\naccused.'' We might also note here that no rules have been framed by the State Government under S. 62, Crl. P.C.\nTherefore, (sic) as it is, there\nappears to us to be no bar to the serving of summons by an officer of the court or other public servant.\n10. The next question that would arise is whether if, even after having recourse to the above provisions, the Magistrate\nis not able to secure the\npresence of the witnesses and the prosecution on its part, even after having been given several opportunities, fails to\nserve the summons on the\nwitnesses or to produce them, the Magistrate would be justified in acquitting the accused either under S. 255(1), Crl. P.\nC. in summons cases or\nunder S. 248(1), Crl. P.C. in warrant cases?\n11. In State of Madhya Pradesh v. Kalthawaix a Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court observed as\nfollows:-\nIt was the duty of the prosecution to make necessary arrangements for the production of its witnesses.... The Police\nmust always remember that it\nhas got a duty to the Court and they cannot just send a challan and think that the rest will be done by the Court. When\nnobody appeared in the\nCourt to inform what the reason was for non-appearance of the witnesses; the Court could legitimately come to the\nconclusion that the police was\nnot very serious in prosecuting the offence which was a minor one. Under S. 245. the Magistrate can record an order of\nacquittal if there is no\nevidence to hold the accused guilty. If the prosecution did not take proper steps to produce the witnesses, or ask the\nCourt to give them time to do\nthe same, or to issue fresh summons, the Court was not bound to fix another date. The police has a duty towards the\ncitizen. When the accused is.\nbrought before the Court and the prosecuting department does not take any steps it will be an abuse of the process of\nthe Court to continue the\ntrial. Bringing a person before the Court accusing him of some offence is a serious matter and however petty the\noffence may be, the prosecuting\ndepartment, must do its duty towards the accused as well as the Court. When once the accused is challenged there is\nno privilege given to the\npolice to remain absent.\nIn that case the accused was prosecuted under S. 34 of the Police Act. The case was to be tried according to the\nprocedure prescribed in the Crl.\nP.C., 1898, for the trial of summons cases, that is, under S. 244, Crl. P.C., of 1898. The cases was posted to a\nparticular date for recording\n\nevidence and earlier at the instance of the prosecution summons had been issued to the prosecution witnesses, but on\nthe date of hearing the\nwitnesses did not tarn up and the learned Magistrate forthwith passed an order of acquittal, aggrieved by which an\nappeal against acquittal was\npreferred by the State which appeal was eventually dismissed by the Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High\nCourt, with the above\nobservations. That was an extreme case.\n12. There are quite a number of decisions in which it had been held that an acquittal of the accused on the failure of the\nprosecution to produce the\nwitnesses is not legal. (Vide State v. Kaliram Nandlal AIR. 1968 P and H.; The State of Mysore v. B. Ramu 1973 M.L.J.\nCri. 16; State of\nMysore v. Kalilulla Ahmed Sheriff; AIR 1971 My. 80 Kindwi Misra v. Sahadev Kunda; I962 2 C.L.J. 295 State of Orissa\nv. Sibcharan Singh;\n1962 (2) Cri LJ. 220 State of Mysore v. Somala; 1972 M.L J. Crl. 476 State of Mysore v. Shanta alias Savitri 1972 M\nL.J.

As against these decisions, there are the following decisions in which it has been held that acquittal on the ground\nof non-production of\nwitnesses by the prosecution was proper. State v. John Abraham 1959 M.L J. Crl. 814; State v. Lakshmana 1966 All.\nL.J. 342; Smt. Jyati\nMoyee Bose v. Birendranath Prodlan A.l.R. 1960 Cal. 263; State v. Ramlal 1961 Crl.L.J. 33. In the first mentioned case,\nState v. John Abraham\n1972 M.L.J. Crl. 10 the case was one of theft and when the case came up for the prosecution to adduce evidence, the\nprosecution riled a report\nstating that the witnesses had refused to execute kychits and seeking orders, but there was no prayer to issue process\nfor compelling the\nattendance of witnesses. The learned single Judge of the Kerala High Court repelled the argument advanced on behalf\nof the State that under S.\n\n251(A)(7) of the Crl. P.C. 1898, the Magistrate was bound to examine all the witnesses mentioned in the police report\nand issue process for their\nappearance in case the prosecution fails to produce them and the learned Judge held that the duty of the Court is only\nto take evidence which is\nready when the case is taken up for hearing and the Magistrate is not bound to go on adjourning the case until all the\nwitnesses mentioned in the\npolice report are examined.\n14. In State v. Lakshmanan 1966 All. L.J. 342, it was held that when the witnesses were not present and did not appear\nwhen called and there\nwas nobody on behalf of the prosecution although the Magistrate contacted the A.P.P. and also the Public Prosecutor\nand no request was made to\nthe Court for any assistance to procure the attendance of the witnesses, it was held that the Magistrate could not be\nsaid to have acted illegally if he\nclosed the case and acquitted the accused.\n15. In Sri Jyothi Mayee Bose v. Birendranath Prodkan, AIR 1960 Cal 265 a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court\nobserved that Sub-s. (6)\nof S. 251(A), Crl. P.C., 1898, does not enjoin upon the Magistrate any duty to compel the attendance of any witness\nunless it was applied for and\nin a case tried under S. 251(A), Crl. P.C. the Magistrate is not compelled as he is, if the case is tried as a warrant case\ninstituted other than on a\npolice report, to proceed in terms of Ss. 256 and 257 of the Code.\n16. In Slate v. Ramlal 1961 2 Crl L.J. 331 a single Judge of the Allahabad High Court observed as follows;-\nS. 252, Crl. P.C. Imposes a duty upon the Magistrate to ascertain the names of the witnesses who can give evidence\non the relevant points and to\nsummon those witnesses in evidence. But, by providing an entirely new procedure, under S. 251(A) Crl. P.C. 1898 in\ncases instituted by the\npolice, the Legislature has deliberately departed from that procedure and in the new procedure has made no provision\nfor summoning of the\nprosecution witnesses. There is therefore no authority in law for the proposition that the Public Prosecutor can make an\napplication for summoning\nof prosecution witnesses and in such a case the Magistrate is found to summon those witnesses.-The whole object of\nthe section appears to have\nbeen that the police should be prepared to produce its witnesses when the case is called upon for hearing an d it\nshould not be permitted to take\nshelter behind the absence of witnesses on account of want of summons by the is Court.\n17. It may be noted that in the old Criminal Procedure Code before the amendment of) 973, of S. 251(A) which dealt\nwith the trial of warrant\ncases instituted on police report there was no provision whereby the Magistrate on the application of the prosecution\ncould issue summons to any\n\nof its witnesses directing him to attend or produce any documents or other thing. In the present Code, there is such a\nprovision in S. 242(e) in\nregard to the trial of warrant cases instituted on a police report and in S. 254(2) in regard to the trial of summons cases.\nTherefore, the aforesaid\nfour decisions would no longer be good law.\n18. In almost all the decisions in which it has been held that an acquittal of the accused on the ground that the\nprosecution did not produce the\nwitnesses was improper, the courts have pointed out that the duty to summon the witnesses in the course of the trial is\nthat of the Magistrate or the\nCourt concerned, and that the entire responsibility of production of witnesses cannot be saddled on the prosecution and\na duty is also imposed\nupon the Court for enforcing the attendance of witnesses by the processes provided in the Code and it is the duty of the\nCourt to issue coercive\nprocesses if in spite of summons served on the witnesses, the witnesses do not appear before the Court and the\nprosecution fails to produce the\nwitnesses as directed. We are in respectful agreement with that view in so far as it emphasizes the duty of the\nMagistrate of the Court. In some of\nthose decisions it has been held that finding the accused not guilty implies that the Court has applied its mind to the\nmerits of the case after\nrecording evidence and then only has found him not guilty. (Vide State of Mysore v. Kalibuliah Ahmed Sheriff A.I. R.\n1971 Mys. 60 and The\nState of Gujarat Vs. Thakorbhai Sukhabhai and Others, State of Rajasthan v. Mukthiar Singh 1965 2 Cri.L.J. 885 State\nof Mysore v. Somala\n1972 M L J Crl. 476; K.K. Subbiyar v. Lakshmana Iyer, 1942 M.W.N.Crl.64 : 55 L.W. 232; State v. Nagappu 1971\nCrl.L.J. 348. We are not\nhowever able to subscribe to that view. No doubt, there is no specific provision in either the relevant sections of Chapter\nXIX which deal with the\ntrial of warrant cases instituted by the Police report by Magistrates or Chapter XX relating to the trial of summons cases\ninstituted on police report,\nfor acquitting the accused on the ground that the prosecution had not produced its evidence. Nevertheless provisions\nhave been made in the\npresent Code, for summons to be issued to the witnesses on the application of the prosecution and a duty is also cast\non the prosecution to\nproduce all its evidence. Thus there is a duty cast on an application by the prosecution to issue summons to the\nwitnesses and secure the presence\nof witnesses by exercising all the powers conferred on it by the Code for that purpose and duty is also cast on the\nprosecution to produce all its\nevidence and to seek the assistance of the Court for so doing by applying to the Court for the issue of summons to the\nwitnesses. Therefore, in our\nview, an acquittal of the accused merely on the ground that the prosecution had not produced the witnesses would not\nbe proper if the Court had\n\nnot on an application by the prosecution discharged its duty of summoning and enforcing the attendance of witnesses.\nWe also notice that almost all\nthe decisions which have held such an acquittal is improper dealt with cases in which the Magistrate had not\ndischarged the aforesaid duty. We\nwould also like to refer to a few other decisions which have a bearing on this matter. The first one is the decision in\nPublic Prosecutor Samangi\nMudaliar 1565 1 L.R. Mad.416 : 77 L.W. 478 to which we had already made a reference. Ramakrishnan, J, held that in\nwarrant cases where the\nCourt had already framed a charge under S. 251-A Crl. P.C., against the accused an important duty was laid on it to\nsee that all the powers\navailable to the Court for the examination of witnesses were exercised for a just decision of the case irrespective of the\nlaces of the complainant.\nTherefore, this Court had already emphasized the important duty laid on the Court to see that all the powers available\nto the Court for the\nexamination of witnesses were exercised for just decision of the case. Likewise, in Paban Chandra Majumdar v. Dulal\nGhosh AIR IWCF 187 it\nwas held that the order of acquittal was unwarranted by law when in a case instituted on a police report the Magistrate\nordered summons to be\nissued to the prosecution witnesses, but after certain adjournments without taking any step for procuring the attendance\nof witnesses to whom\nsummonses were issued he proceeded further and after examining the accused who pleaded not guilty passed an\norder of acquittal. In The State of\nBihar Vs. Polo Mistry and Others, it was observed by a single Judge of the Patna High Court as follows.\nWhere the prosecutor in a criminal trial has himself undertaken to produce the prosecution witnesses the entire\nresponsibility for the production of\nthe evidence in support of the prosecution case is that of the prosecutor. But when the prosecutor has taken recourse\nto the agency of the Court\nfor securing the attendance of the prosecution witnesses it is undoubtedly the duty of Magistrate to take steps for\nsecuring the attendance of the\nprosecution witnesses in his Court. Where therefore, in the latter case, none of the prosecution witnesses turn up in\nspite of the service of the\nsummons issued by the Court on them and there are no materials to indicate that there was any reasonable cause for\ntheir failure to appear, the\nproper course for the Magistrate is to take necessary steps to compel the attendance of the witnesses and it is wrong\non his part to proceed to\nacquit the accused on the footing that there is no evidence against them.\n19. It was further observed-\nIt is undoubtedly the duty of the Magistrate to take steps for securing the attendance of the prosecution witnesses in his\nCourt and it cannot be held\n\nthat the entire responsibility for securing the attendance of prosecution witnesses lies upon the prosecutor atone. It is\nonly where the prosecutor\nfinds himself unable to produce the prosecution witnesses through his own agency that he relies upon the agency of the\nCourt for securing the\nattendance of the prosecution witnesses- In such an event, it is the duty of the Magistrate concerned to take all such\nmeasures as may be found\nnecessary under the law to compel the attendance of the prosecution witnesses.\n20. On the question as to whether Magistrate can acquit an accused at all under S. 251-A(ll),Crl. P.C. if the prosecution\nfailed to produce their\nwitnesses, a Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court observed in State of Gujarat v. Bava Bhadya 1962 2 CrI. L.J. 537\nas follows-\nWhere a charge is framed in a warrant case on police report, if owing to the failure of the prosecution to produce their\nwitnesses and owing also to\nthe failure of the prosecution to make full endeavour to serve the summonses according to the provisions contained in\nSs. 69, 70 and 71, Crl. P.C.\n1896 there is no evidence before the Magistrate, the Magistrate can acquit the accused under S. 25A(11).\n21. In State of Karnataka v, Subramania Setty 1980 M.L.J. Crl.131, a Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court\nreferring to the decisions in\nState of Mysore v. Narasimla Gowda 1964 2 Mys. L.J. 241 and the State of Mysore v. Atdul Uameed Khan, 1869 1 L.J\nMys 4 observed that\nthe real distinction between the two decisions is as to whether there was remissness and want of diligence on the part\nof the prosecuting agency in\nproducing the witnesses before the Court and therefore, the principle laid down in Abdul Hameed Khan''s case 1980 M\nLJ. (Crl) 138 applied to\nthe facts of the case with which the Division Bench was concerned. We may note here that in Atdul Uameed Khan''s\ncase 1869 1 Mys L.J 4, it\nwas found on the facts that the prosecution was not at all diligent as the non-bailable warrants issued to the witnesses\nhad neither been served nor\nreturned to the Court by the concerned police and it was therefore held that where the prosecution was not diligent In\nproducing its witnesses and\nhad failed to serve the bailable warrants on the witnesses and return the same the Magistrate would be justified in\nrefusing to grant an adjournment\nand to proceed to acquit the accused on the material on record. We may note here that in State of Kirnataka v.\nSubramani Setty 1980 M.L.J.\n(Crl) 138 the Division Bench was dealing with a summons case instituted on a police report.\n22. After carefully considering all the aforesaid decisions and the views expressed therein, we are of the view that if the\nprosecution had made an\napplication for the issue of summons to its witnesses either under S. 242(2) or 254(2) of the Crl. P.C. it is the duty of the\nCourt to issue summons\n\nto the prosecution witnesses and to secure the witnesses by exercising all the powers given to it under the Crl. P.C. as\nalready indicated by us and\nif still the presence of the witnesses could not be secured and the prosecution also either on account of pronounced\nnegligence or recalcitrance\ndoes not produce the witnesses after the Court had given it sufficient time and opportunities to do so, then the Court,\nbeing left with no other\nalternative, would be justified in acquitting the accused for want of evidence to prove the prosecution case, under S.\n248, Crl. P. C. in the case of\nwarrant cases instituted on a police report and under S. 255(1), Crl. P.C. in summons cases, and we answer the two\nquestions referred to us in\nthe above terms.\n23. Coming now to these appeals, we might note here that the offences with which the respondents-accused have been\ncharged are offences under\nS. 4(1)(b) of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition Act, and those prosecutions were launched nearly four years ago. Furthermore,\nthe prosecution had not,\nin spite of notices, attempted to produce the witnesses and in fact were quite non-co-operative in their attitude. In view\nof these circumstances,\nwhile pointing out that the acquittal of the respondents-accused in the circumstances of these cases is not proper,\ninasmuch as the Court had not\ndischarged its duty as indicated by us as above, we do not want to interfere with that acquittal at this length of time and\nhence we dismiss these\nappeals.",
