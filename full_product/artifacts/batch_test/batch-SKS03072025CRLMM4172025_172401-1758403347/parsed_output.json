JUSTICE SWARANA KANTA SHARMA\nJUDGMENT\nDR. SWARANA KANTA SHARMA, J\n1. The petitioner, by way of this petition, seeks setting aside of\norder of cognizance dated 08.02.2024 [hereafter „impugned order‟]\npassed by the learned Special Judge (PC Act)(ACB)-02, Rouse\nAvenue District Courts, New Delhi [hereafter „Special Judge‟] in CC\nNo. 28/2023, arising out of FIR No. 36/2018, registered on\n07.02.2018 at Police Station Dwarka-South, Delhi, for offence\npunishable under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860\n[hereafter „IPC‟]. The petitioner further seeks quashing of\nsupplementary chargesheet dated 05.02.2024 filed qua the petitioner\nin the said case.\nCRL. M.C. 417/2025 Page 1 of 12\n\n2. The present FIR was registered on the complaint of Mr. G.C.\nJoshi, Director, Centre for Cultural Resources and Training (CCRT),\nan autonomous organization under the aegis of the Ministry of\nCulture, Government of India, with its office located at Plot No. 15A,\nSector-7, Dwarka, New Delhi. The complaint was received vide DD\nNo. 27B dated 21.09.2017 at Police Station Dwarka South, Delhi. It\nwas alleged that the CCRT provides scholarships to children aged\nbetween 10 to 14 years across various fields of art under a national-\nlevel scheme. Several complaints were received from the parents of\nselected scholarship recipients, stating that the scholarship amount had\nnot been credited to their accounts, despite the same having been\ndebited from the CCRT‟s account. It was further alleged that one\nSandip Kumar, who had worked as a Programmer on a contractual\nbasis for approximately seven years, had committed the fraud by\ntaking advantage of a newly introduced system of transferring\nscholarship amounts via RTGS/NEFT mode starting in 2014. Under\nthis system, the details of selected scholars, including their names,\nbank details, scholarship amount, and IDs, were forwarded by the\nScholarship Section to the Accounts Section. The Accounts Section\nwould then send this data in soft copy to the Canara Bank located in\nthe same complex for processing the fund transfers. Sandip Kumar\nallegedly manipulated these lists by deleting the names of actual\nbeneficiaries and inserting his own name, along with those of his wife\nand certain associates or acquaintances. Based on the above\nallegations, the present FIR was registered.\nCRL. M.C. 417/2025 Page 2 of 12\n\n3. The records of the case reveal further that during the course of\ninvestigation, one Brijesh Kumar had approached the Hon‟ble Delhi\nHigh Court by way of W.P.(CRL.) 687/2019 seeking transfer of the\ninvestigation to the CBI. However, vide order dated 06.03.2018, the\ninvestigation was instead transferred to the Crime Branch. Upon\ncompletion of investigation, a chargesheet was filed on 15.10.2018\nbefore the learned CMM, Dwarka Courts, against 11 accused persons\nunder Sections 408/409/420/471/201/120B/34 of IPC. Subsequently,\nduring further investigation, Sections 7 and 13 of the Prevention of\nCorruption Act, 1988 were also invoked against Mr. Girish Chandra\nJoshi, Mr. Anil Kohli, and others. A supplementary chargesheet was\nfiled against accused persons numbered 12 to 16. Cognizance was\ntaken by the learned Special Court on 27.10.2020.\n4. During the stage of framing of charges, the learned Special\nJudge, vide order dated 29.03.2022, directed the matter to be sent back\nfor further investigation, observing certain lacunae in the\ninvestigation, and instructed the concerned Investigating Officer (IO)\nto file a final report within six months. The original documents and\nthe earlier final report were returned to the investigating agency for\nthis purpose. In compliance with the said direction, a fresh\nchargesheet was filed on 20.04.2023 against 16 accused persons.\nSubsequently, on 02.11.2023, a first supplementary chargesheet was\nfiled to place on record a certificate under Section 65B of the Indian\nEvidence Act pertaining to bank account statements.\n5. It is pertinent to note that in the main chargesheet, the petitioner\nCRL. M.C. 417/2025 Page 3 of 12\n\nherein was neither named as an accused nor shown as a suspect in\nColumn 12. However, her name appeared in the list of account holders\nwho had allegedly received amounts in connection with the fraudulent\ntransactions. On 02.11.2023, during the course of proceedings, the\nlearned Special Judge observed that the surety for Accused No. 4 (Mr.\nProsanta Mondal) was one Ms. Mili Debnath, the petitioner herein,\nand accordingly directed the IO to verify whether she was the same\nMili Debnath who had allegedly received an amount of ₹25,200 from\nCCRT on 02.12.2016.\n6. Pursuant to the said direction, on 08.02.2024, the IO submitted\nthat Ms. Mili Debnath, the surety for Accused No. 4, was indeed the\nsame person who had received ₹25,200 from CCRT on the stated date\nin connection with the fraudulent transactions carried out by Accused\nNo. 1. Accordingly, the IO, ACP Naresh Kumar, submitted a\nsupplementary chargesheet (the impugned supplementary\nchargesheet) placing the petitioner in Column 12 of the chargesheet.\n7. On the same date, i.e., 08.02.2024, the learned Special Judge\npassed the impugned order taking cognizance against the petitioner\nand summoned her accordingly. The said order reads as under:\n“4. Upon inquiry regarding the direction given vide paragraph\n5 of the order dated 02.11.2023, the IO, ACP Naresh Kumar\nhas submitted that Ms. Mili Debnath, the surety of the accused\nno.4 (Sh. Prosanta Mandal) is the Ms. Mili Debnath, who had\nreceived Rs.25,200/ from CCRT, on account of the alleged\nfraud committed by the accused no.1, on 02.12.2016 and who\nwas shown untraced in the charge sheets filed till date. Further,\nthe IO, ACP Naresh Kumar has submitted that he has now\nfiled a supplementary charge sheet in respect of Ms. Mili\nCRL. M.C. 417/2025 Page 4 of 12\n\nDebnath, placing her as a suspect in column no.12.\n5. The aforesaid charge sheet has been perused. Upon perusal\nthereof, I am unable to agree with the conclusion of the IO that\nMs. Mili Debnath should not be summoned to face trial in this\ncase because she had provided her account number to her\nhusband (accused no.4, Sh. Prosanta Mandal), who had in turn\nprovided it to the accused no.1, Sh. Sandip Kumar; because she\nhad no direct contact with the accused no.1, Sh. Sandip Kumar\nand because upon withdrawal of the part amount of Rs.15,000/\n(out of Rs.25,200/ ), she had immediately given the said\namount to her husband (accused no.4, Sh. Prosanta Mandal).\nIn my view, the fact that Ms. Mili Debnath had accepted\nRs.25,200/ in her bank account without any protest and also\nallowed part of it viz. Rs.10,000/ - to be apportioned towards a\nloan is indicative of the position that Ms. Mili Debnath was\nequally complicit in the offences, alleged to have been\ncommitted in this case. Also, in my view, if Ms. Mili Debnath\nis let off, equity will get created in favour of the other accused,\nwho also did not have any direct contact with the accused no.1,\nSh. Sandip Kumar and had provided their bank accounts\nthrough accused like Sh. Kaushik Sinha Roy and Sh. Vishnu\nPrasad Tiwari. Accordingly, on the basis of all the\ncharge sheets filed till date, the cognizance of the subject\noffences is taken qua the accused, Ms. Mili Debnath also. Let\nthe said accused be summoned through the IO, ACP Naresh\nKumar, for the next date.\n6. List for hearing of arguments on charge, on 07.03.2024.”\n8. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner contends that\nthe petitioner has been falsely implicated in the present case, and that\nthe order dated 08.02.2024 passed by the learned Special Judge is\ncontrary to the settled principles of law. It is further submitted that the\nlearned Special Judge erred in making observations against the\npetitioner by holding that the acceptance of ₹25,200/- in her bank\naccount without protest, and permitting adjustment of ₹10,000/-\ntowards a prior loan, was indicative of her complicity in the alleged\nCRL. M.C. 417/2025 Page 5 of 12\n\noffences. The learned counsel argues that mere ownership of the bank\naccount does not establish knowledge or involvement in the\ntransaction, especially when the transfer was made online without any\ncommunication to the petitioner regarding its purpose or source.\n9. It is further submitted that the petitioner had shared her bank\naccount details with her husband in good faith, and had no knowledge\neither of the sender or of the reason behind the remittance. Her\nhusband had sought her account details under the impression that he\nwas receiving his long-overdue remuneration from Mr. Koushik Sinha\nRoy, for having assisted him and CCRT in organizing cultural\nprograms in remote areas of West Bengal. It is contended that the\nInvestigating Agency has not brought on record any new material\nagainst the petitioner in the supplementary charge sheet, which merely\nreiterates the same facts regarding the money transfer that were\nalready reflected in the earlier charge sheet. The petitioner‟s name, it\nis argued, was mentioned only in Column No. 12 as a beneficiary,\nwithout any overt act or criminal intent being attributed to her.\nTherefore, it is prayed that the present petition be allowed.\n10. The learned APP for the State submits that investigation in this\ncase revealed that the petitioner, Ms. Mili Debnath, was not associated\nwith CCRT or with any of the accused persons, including Mr.\nKoushik Sinha Roy and Mr. Sandip Kumar. It is stated that she had\nprovided her bank account details to her husband, Mr. Prosanta\nMondal, out of trust, being his wife. However, the fact remains that a\nsum of ₹25,200/- was transferred from the CCRT‟s bank account into\nCRL. M.C. 417/2025 Page 6 of 12\n\nher account, making her a beneficiary of the cheated amount.\nAccordingly, her name was reflected in Column No. 12 of the second\nsupplementary charge sheet. It is further submitted that based on this\nsupplementary charge sheet, the learned Special Judge took\ncognizance of the matter and passed the impugned order dated\n08.02.2024.\n11. This Court has heard arguments addressed on behalf of either\nside, and has perused the material placed on record.\n12. This Court is of the opinion that after registration of the FIR,\nthe investigating agency initially investigated the case, and\nsubsequently, vide order dated 29.03.2022, the learned Special Judge\ndirected further investigation. Pursuant to this direction, further\ninvestigation was carried out and a fresh chargesheet was filed on\n20.04.2023, wherein the present petitioner was not named as an\naccused. Thereafter, a supplementary chargesheet dated 05.02.2024\nwas filed, in which the petitioner was mentioned in Column No. 12.\nAs per the Status Report and the said supplementary chargesheet, even\nafter further investigation, the investigating agency has attributed the\nfollowing role to the petitioner:\nA sum of ₹25,200/- was credited to the petitioner‟s bank\n●\naccount at Bangiya Gramin Vikash Bank, Taldi Branch, District\n24 Parganas South, West Bengal on 02.12.2016, from the bank\naccount of CCRT. Of this amount, ₹10,000/- was adjusted by\nthe bank towards an earlier advance on 03.12.2016, and\nCRL. M.C. 417/2025 Page 7 of 12\n\n₹15,000/- was withdrawn in cash.\nThe petitioner, Ms. Mili Debnath, stated that she was residing\n●\nwith her husband and children and earned a livelihood by\ngiving private tuitions. She disclosed that her husband had\nasked for her bank account details to receive some money, and\nshe had shared them in good faith. Upon receipt of the amount,\nshe had withdrawn ₹15,000/- at her husband‟s instructions and\nhad handed it over to him. She claimed to have no knowledge\nof the sender or the purpose of the remittance.\nDuring investigation, her husband, Mr. Prosanta Mondal,\n●\nadmitted that he had provided both his and his wife‟s bank\naccount details to receive funds from Mr. Koushik Sinha Roy of\nCCRT, purportedly for helping organize cultural events. He\nconfirmed that ₹25,200/- was received in his wife‟s account, of\nwhich ₹15,000/- was handed over to him and ₹10,000/- was\nadjusted by the bank.\nThe investigation did not reveal association of the petitioner\n●\nwith CCRT or any of the accused persons. However, since the\nsum of ₹25,200/-, allegedly being part of the cheated amount,\nwas received in her bank account, her name was included in\nColumn No. 12 of the second supplementary chargesheet as a\nbeneficiary.\n13. This Court is of the view that there is no cavil regarding the\nsettled position of law that an accused can be summoned even if he or\nshe is shown in Column No. 12 of the chargesheet, i.e., as a suspect.\nCRL. M.C. 417/2025 Page 8 of 12\n\nThe learned Special Judge is not bound by the conclusion drawn by\nthe investigating agency and is well within his powers to differ from\nthe opinion of the investigating agency, if the material on record\njustifies summoning the accused. However, in a case where an\naccused was not named in the chargesheet earlier, and even now, she\nhas been kept in Column No. 12 filed after further investigation, and\nwhere the investigating agency has once again concluded that there is\nno sufficient evidence against such accused, the learned Special Judge\nis expected to record reasons for taking a contrary view and for\nsummoning such a person to face trial. In the present case, this Court\nnotes that the investigation has revealed that the petitioner is the wife\nof one of the co-accused, namely, Prosanta Mondal. It has further\ncome to light that the petitioner was not found to be connected with\nthe alleged offence in any manner, and she was never arrested during\nthe course of investigation.\n14. The learned Special Judge, in the impugned order, has opined\nthat – “In my view, the fact that Ms. Mili Debnath had accepted\nRs.25,200/ in her bank account without any protest and also allowed\npart of it viz. Rs.10,000/ - to be apportioned towards a loan is\nindicative of the position that Ms. Mili Debnath was equally complicit\nin the offences, alleged to have been committed in this case. Also, in\nmy view, if Ms. Mili Debnath is let off, equity will get created in\nfavour of the other accused, who also did not have any direct contact\nwith the accused no.1, Sh. Sandip Kumar and had provided their bank\naccounts through accused like Sh. Kaushik Sinha Roy and Sh. Vishnu\nCRL. M.C. 417/2025 Page 9 of 12\n\nPrasad Tiwari.” However, this Court notes that, as per the fresh\nchargesheet, the specific and detailed roles of co-accused Sandip\nKumar, Vishnu Prasad Tiwari @ Rajesh Tiwari, Jay Prakash Pal @\nNanhe, Chandra Prakash Mishra, Prosanta Mondal, Kaushik Sinha\nRoy, Mihir Chakraborty, Supriya Das, Tapasi Mukherjee, Deep\nMishra, and Nabendu Gupta have been clearly outlined. Therefore, the\nreasoning that summoning Ms. Mili Debnath was necessary to avoid\ncreating equity in favour of the other accused is misplaced. Even\notherwise, if there is insufficient evidence against a particular accused,\nthe mere apprehension that it may create parity or equity with other\naccused persons cannot, in law, be a valid ground to summon such a\nperson to face trial. Summoning must be based solely on the material\non record demonstrating prima facie involvement in the alleged\noffence.\n15. The law is well-settled that before a person can be summoned to\nface trial, there must be sufficient material on record to give rise to a\nstrong suspicion that the person was involved in the commission of\nthe offence. In particular, the Court must be satisfied that: (i) the\naccused was prima facie a party to the offence, and (ii) there exists\nsufficient ground to justify summoning him/her to stand trial. It is\nequally settled that facing a criminal trial is not a matter to be taken\nlightly, as it entails serious consequences for the individual concerned,\nincluding social stigma, mental agony, and reputational harm. In Pepsi\nFoods Ltd. v. Special Judicial Magistrate: (1998) 5 SCC 749, the\nHon‟ble Supreme Court emphasized that summoning of an accused in\nCRL. M.C. 417/2025 Page 10 of 12\n\na criminal case is a serious matter, and the criminal law cannot be set\ninto motion as a matter of course.\n16. In the present case, the learned Special Judge has not recorded\nany cogent reason for disagreeing with the investigating agency‟s\nconsistent stand in both the chargesheet and the supplementary\nchargesheet that no evidence was found against the petitioner. There is\nno indication in the impugned order as to what material was relied\nupon to differ from the conclusion of the investigating agency or how\nthe petitioner could be linked either with the alleged conspiracy or the\nsubstantive offence. The petitioner has not been arrested during\ninvestigation, and no role has been attributed to her beyond the mere\nreceipt of money in her account, which the chargesheet itself explains\nand does not attribute any criminal intent to.\n17. Summoning an accused merely on the apprehension that letting\nhim or her off may create equity in favour of other co-accused –\nwithout any supporting evidence – cannot form the legal basis for\ncompelling a person to undergo the rigors of trial. In the absence of\nclear and sufficient reasons justifying such disagreement with the\ninvestigation, and without any material demonstrating the petitioner‟s\ninvolvement in the offence, this Court is of the opinion that the\nsummoning order is legally unsustainable.\n18. Accordingly, the order of cognizance dated 08.02.2024 passed\nby the learned Special Judge is quashed.\n19. In view of the above, the present petition stands disposed of.\nCRL. M.C. 417/2025 Page 11 of 12\n\nPending application, if any, also stands disposed of.\n20. The judgment be uploaded on the website forthwith.\nDR. SWARANA KANTA SHARMA, J\nJULY 03, 2025/vc\nCRL.

The complaint was received vide DD\nNo. 27B dated 21.09.2017 at Police Station Dwarka South, Delhi. It\nwas alleged that the CCRT provides scholarships to children aged\nbetween 10 to 14 years across various fields of art under a national-\nlevel scheme. Several complaints were received from the parents of\nselected scholarship recipients, stating that the scholarship amount had\nnot been credited to their accounts, despite the same having been\ndebited from the CCRT‟s account.

It is further submitted that based on this\nsupplementary charge sheet, the learned Special Judge took\ncognizance of the matter and passed the impugned order dated\n08.02.2024.\n11. This Court has heard arguments addressed on behalf of either\nside, and has perused the material placed on record.\n12. This Court is of the opinion that after registration of the FIR,\nthe investigating agency initially investigated the case, and\nsubsequently, vide order dated 29.03.2022, the learned Special Judge\ndirected further investigation. Pursuant to this direction, further\ninvestigation was carried out and a fresh chargesheet was filed on\n20.04.2023, wherein the present petitioner was not named as an\naccused. Thereafter, a supplementary chargesheet dated 05.02.2024\nwas filed, in which the petitioner was mentioned in Column No. 12.\nAs per the Status Report and the said supplementary chargesheet, even\nafter further investigation, the investigating agency has attributed the\nfollowing role to the petitioner:\nA sum of ₹25,200/- was credited to the petitioner‟s bank\n●\naccount at Bangiya Gramin Vikash Bank, Taldi Branch, District\n24 Parganas South, West Bengal on 02.12.2016, from the bank\naccount of CCRT. Of this amount, ₹10,000/- was adjusted by\nthe bank towards an earlier advance on 03.12.2016, and\nCRL. M.C. 417/2025 Page 7 of 12\n\n₹15,000/- was withdrawn in cash.\nThe petitioner, Ms. Mili Debnath, stated that she was residing\n●\nwith her husband and children and earned a livelihood by\ngiving private tuitions. She disclosed that her husband had\nasked for her bank account details to receive some money, and\nshe had shared them in good faith. Upon receipt of the amount,\nshe had withdrawn ₹15,000/- at her husband‟s instructions and\nhad handed it over to him. She claimed to have no knowledge\nof the sender or the purpose of the remittance.\nDuring investigation, her husband, Mr. Prosanta Mondal,\n●\nadmitted that he had provided both his and his wife‟s bank\naccount details to receive funds from Mr. Koushik Sinha Roy of\nCCRT, purportedly for helping organize cultural events. He\nconfirmed that ₹25,200/- was received in his wife‟s account, of\nwhich ₹15,000/- was handed over to him and ₹10,000/- was\nadjusted by the bank.\nThe investigation did not reveal association of the petitioner\n●\nwith CCRT or any of the accused persons. However, since the\nsum of ₹25,200/-, allegedly being part of the cheated amount,\nwas received in her bank account, her name was included in\nColumn No. 12 of the second supplementary chargesheet as a\nbeneficiary.\n13. This Court is of the view that there is no cavil regarding the\nsettled position of law that an accused can be summoned even if he or\nshe is shown in Column No. 12 of the chargesheet, i.e., as a suspect.\nCRL. M.C. 417/2025 Page 8 of 12\n\nThe learned Special Judge is not bound by the conclusion drawn by\nthe investigating agency and is well within his powers to differ from\nthe opinion of the investigating agency, if the material on record\njustifies summoning the accused. However, in a case where an\naccused was not named in the chargesheet earlier, and even now, she\nhas been kept in Column No. 12 filed after further investigation, and\nwhere the investigating agency has once again concluded that there is\nno sufficient evidence against such accused, the learned Special Judge\nis expected to record reasons for taking a contrary view and for\nsummoning such a person to face trial. In the present case, this Court\nnotes that the investigation has revealed that the petitioner is the wife\nof one of the co-accused, namely, Prosanta Mondal. It has further\ncome to light that the petitioner was not found to be connected with\nthe alleged offence in any manner, and she was never arrested during\nthe course of investigation.\n14. The learned Special Judge, in the impugned order, has opined\nthat – “In my view, the fact that Ms. Mili Debnath had accepted\nRs.25,200/ in her bank account without any protest and also allowed\npart of it viz. Rs.10,000/ - to be apportioned towards a loan is\nindicative of the position that Ms. Mili Debnath was equally complicit\nin the offences, alleged to have been committed in this case. Also, in\nmy view, if Ms. Mili Debnath is let off, equity will get created in\nfavour of the other accused, who also did not have any direct contact\nwith the accused no.1, Sh. Sandip Kumar and had provided their bank\naccounts through accused like Sh. Kaushik Sinha Roy and Sh. Vishnu\nCRL. M.C. 417/2025 Page 9 of 12\n\nPrasad Tiwari.” However, this Court notes that, as per the fresh\nchargesheet, the specific and detailed roles of co-accused Sandip\nKumar, Vishnu Prasad Tiwari @ Rajesh Tiwari, Jay Prakash Pal @\nNanhe, Chandra Prakash Mishra, Prosanta Mondal, Kaushik Sinha\nRoy, Mihir Chakraborty, Supriya Das, Tapasi Mukherjee, Deep\nMishra, and Nabendu Gupta have been clearly outlined. Therefore, the\nreasoning that summoning Ms. Mili Debnath was necessary to avoid\ncreating equity in favour of the other accused is misplaced. Even\notherwise, if there is insufficient evidence against a particular accused,\nthe mere apprehension that it may create parity or equity with other\naccused persons cannot, in law, be a valid ground to summon such a\nperson to face trial. Summoning must be based solely on the material\non record demonstrating prima facie involvement in the alleged\noffence.\n15. The law is well-settled that before a person can be summoned to\nface trial, there must be sufficient material on record to give rise to a\nstrong suspicion that the person was involved in the commission of\nthe offence. In particular, the Court must be satisfied that: (i) the\naccused was prima facie a party to the offence, and (ii) there exists\nsufficient ground to justify summoning him/her to stand trial. It is\nequally settled that facing a criminal trial is not a matter to be taken\nlightly, as it entails serious consequences for the individual concerned,\nincluding social stigma, mental agony, and reputational harm. In Pepsi\nFoods Ltd. v. Special Judicial Magistrate: (1998) 5 SCC 749, the\nHon‟ble Supreme Court emphasized that summoning of an accused in\nCRL. M.C. 417/2025 Page 10 of 12\n\na criminal case is a serious matter, and the criminal law cannot be set\ninto motion as a matter of course.\n16. In the present case, the learned Special Judge has not recorded\nany cogent reason for disagreeing with the investigating agency‟s\nconsistent stand in both the chargesheet and the supplementary\nchargesheet that no evidence was found against the petitioner. There is\nno indication in the impugned order as to what material was relied\nupon to differ from the conclusion of the investigating agency or how\nthe petitioner could be linked either with the alleged conspiracy or the\nsubstantive offence. The petitioner has not been arrested during\ninvestigation, and no role has been attributed to her beyond the mere\nreceipt of money in her account, which the chargesheet itself explains\nand does not attribute any criminal intent to.\n17. Summoning an accused merely on the apprehension that letting\nhim or her off may create equity in favour of other co-accused –\nwithout any supporting evidence – cannot form the legal basis for\ncompelling a person to undergo the rigors of trial. In the absence of\nclear and sufficient reasons justifying such disagreement with the\ninvestigation, and without any material demonstrating the petitioner‟s\ninvolvement in the offence, this Court is of the opinion that the\nsummoning order is legally unsustainable.\n18. Accordingly, the order of cognizance dated 08.02.2024 passed\nby the learned Special Judge is quashed.\n19. In view of the above, the present petition stands disposed of.\nCRL. M.C. 417/2025 Page 11 of 12\n\nPending application, if any, also stands disposed of.\n20. The judgment be uploaded on the website forthwith.\nDR. SWARANA KANTA SHARMA, J\nJULY 03, 2025/vc\nCRL.

Thereafter, a supplementary chargesheet dated 05.02.2024\nwas filed, in which the petitioner was mentioned in Column No. 12.\nAs per the Status Report and the said supplementary chargesheet, even\nafter further investigation, the investigating agency has attributed the\nfollowing role to the petitioner:\nA sum of ₹25,200/- was credited to the petitioner‟s bank\n●\naccount at Bangiya Gramin Vikash Bank, Taldi Branch, District\n24 Parganas South, West Bengal on 02.12.2016, from the bank\naccount of CCRT. Of this amount, ₹10,000/- was adjusted by\nthe bank towards an earlier advance on 03.12.2016, and\nCRL. M.C. 417/2025 Page 7 of 12",

She disclosed that her husband had\nasked for her bank account details to receive some money, and\nshe had shared them in good faith. Upon receipt of the amount,\nshe had withdrawn ₹15,000/- at her husband‟s instructions and\nhad handed it over to him.

He\nconfirmed that ₹25,200/- was received in his wife‟s account, of\nwhich ₹15,000/- was handed over to him and ₹10,000/- was\nadjusted by the bank.\nThe investigation did not reveal association of the petitioner\n●\nwith CCRT or any of the accused persons.

This Court is of the view that there is no cavil regarding the\nsettled position of law that an accused can be summoned even if he or\nshe is shown in Column No. 12 of the chargesheet, i.e., as a suspect.\nCRL.

However, in a case where an\naccused was not named in the chargesheet earlier, and even now, she\nhas been kept in Column No. 12 filed after further investigation, and\nwhere the investigating agency has once again concluded that there is\nno sufficient evidence against such accused, the learned Special Judge\nis expected to record reasons for taking a contrary view and for\nsummoning such a person to face trial. In the present case, this Court\nnotes that the investigation has revealed that the petitioner is the wife\nof one of the co-accused, namely, Prosanta Mondal. It has further\ncome to light that the petitioner was not found to be connected with\nthe alleged offence in any manner, and she was never arrested during\nthe course of investigation.\n14. The learned Special Judge, in the impugned order, has opined\nthat – “In my view, the fact that Ms. Mili Debnath had accepted\nRs.25,200/ in her bank account without any protest and also allowed\npart of it viz. Rs.10,000/ - to be apportioned towards a loan is\nindicative of the position that Ms. Mili Debnath was equally complicit\nin the offences, alleged to have been committed in this case. Also, in\nmy view, if Ms. Mili Debnath is let off, equity will get created in\nfavour of the other accused, who also did not have any direct contact\nwith the accused no.1, Sh.

Therefore, the\nreasoning that summoning Ms. Mili Debnath was necessary to avoid\ncreating equity in favour of the other accused is misplaced. Even\notherwise, if there is insufficient evidence against a particular accused,\nthe mere apprehension that it may create parity or equity with other\naccused persons cannot, in law, be a valid ground to summon such a\nperson to face trial. Summoning must be based solely on the material\non record demonstrating prima facie involvement in the alleged\noffence.\n15. The law is well-settled that before a person can be summoned to\nface trial, there must be sufficient material on record to give rise to a\nstrong suspicion that the person was involved in the commission of\nthe offence. In particular, the Court must be satisfied that: (i) the\naccused was prima facie a party to the offence, and (ii) there exists\nsufficient ground to justify summoning him/her to stand trial. It is\nequally settled that facing a criminal trial is not a matter to be taken\nlightly, as it entails serious consequences for the individual concerned,\nincluding social stigma, mental agony, and reputational harm.

In the present case, the learned Special Judge has not recorded\nany cogent reason for disagreeing with the investigating agency‟s\nconsistent stand in both the chargesheet and the supplementary\nchargesheet that no evidence was found against the petitioner. There is\nno indication in the impugned order as to what material was relied\nupon to differ from the conclusion of the investigating agency or how\nthe petitioner could be linked either with the alleged conspiracy or the\nsubstantive offence. The petitioner has not been arrested during\ninvestigation, and no role has been attributed to her beyond the mere\nreceipt of money in her account, which the chargesheet itself explains\nand does not attribute any criminal intent to.\n17. Summoning an accused merely on the apprehension that letting\nhim or her off may create equity in favour of other co-accused –\nwithout any supporting evidence – cannot form the legal basis for\ncompelling a person to undergo the rigors of trial. In the absence of\nclear and sufficient reasons justifying such disagreement with the\ninvestigation, and without any material demonstrating the petitioner‟s\ninvolvement in the offence, this Court is of the opinion that the\nsummoning order is legally unsustainable.\n18. Accordingly, the order of cognizance dated 08.02.2024 passed\nby the learned Special Judge is quashed.\n19. In view of the above, the present petition stands disposed of.\nCRL.
