The learned Special Judge is not bound by the conclusion drawn by
the investigating agency and is well within his powers to differ from
the opinion of the investigating agency, if the material on record
justifies summoning the accused. However, in a case where an
accused was not named in the chargesheet earlier, and even now, she
has been kept in Column No. 12 filed after further investigation, and
where the investigating agency has once again concluded that there is
no sufficient evidence against such accused, the learned Special Judge
is expected to record reasons for taking a contrary view and for
summoning such a person to face trial. In the present case, this Court
notes that the investigation has revealed that the petitioner is the wife
of one of the co-accused, namely, Prosanta Mondal. It has further
come to light that the petitioner was not found to be connected with
the alleged offence in any manner, and she was never arrested during
the course of investigation.
14. The learned Special Judge, in the impugned order, has opined
that – “In my view, the fact that Ms. Mili Debnath had accepted
Rs.25,200/ in her bank account without any protest and also allowed
part of it viz. Rs.10,000/ - to be apportioned towards a loan is
indicative of the position that Ms. Mili Debnath was equally complicit
in the offences, alleged to have been committed in this case. Also, in
my view, if Ms. Mili Debnath is let off, equity will get created in
favour of the other accused, who also did not have any direct contact
with the accused no.1, Sh. Sandip Kumar and had provided their bank
accounts through accused like Sh. Kaushik Sinha Roy and Sh. Vishnu
