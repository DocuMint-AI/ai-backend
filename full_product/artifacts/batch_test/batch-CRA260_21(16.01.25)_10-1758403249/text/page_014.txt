requirement is concerned, it can be seen that the
Legislature intended that only certain Magistrates and
certain officers of higher rank and empowered can act
to effect the arrest or search. This is a safeguard
provided having regard to the deterrent sentences
contemplated and with a view that innocent persons
are not harassed. Therefore if an arrest or search
contemplated under these provisions of NDPS Act has
to be carried out, the same can be done only by
competent and empowered Magistrates or officers
mentioned thereunder.”
Furthermore, their Lordships in paragraph 14 have held that
whether there was such reason to believe and whether the officer
empowered acted in a bona fide manner, depends upon the facts
and circumstances of the case and will have a bearing in
appreciation of the evidence.
18. Even in Baldev Singh’s case (supra), their Lordships of the
Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court with regard to Section
42(1) of the NDPS Act have held in paragraphs 9 & 10 as under: -
“9. Sub-section (1) of Section 42 lays down that the
empowered officer, if has a prior information given by
any person, he should necessarily take it down in
writing and where he has reason to believe from his
personal knowledge that offences under Chapter IV
have been committed or that materials which may
furnish evidence of commission of such offences are
concealed in any building etc. he may carry out the
arrest or search, without a warrant between sunrise
and sunset, and he may do so without
recording his reasons of belief.
