enumerated in Section 32B(a to f) are present award
of sentence higher than minimum can be interfered

24. In the present case The High Court held that
although gross quantity of 8.175 Kg. of Heroin was
alleged to have been recovered from the appellant
but actual quantity of Heroine which was found to be
in possession was only 609.6 gm. The High Court
held that since the appellant was found in
possession of Narcotic Drugs as per the analysis
report to 609.6 gm. which is much higher than the
commercial quantity, punishment higher than the
minimum is justified. The High Court reduced the
punishment from 18 years to 16 years. We, thus,
uphold the judgment of the trial court and the High
Court awarding the punishment higher than the
minimum, however, looking to all the facts and
circumstances of the present case including the fact
that it was found by the High Court that the appellant
was only a carrier, we find that the ends of justice
will be sub-served in reducing the sentence from 16
years to 12 years. Thus, while maintaining the
conviction of the appellant the appellant is
sentenced to undergo 12 years rigorous
imprisonment with fine of Rs. 2 lakh and in default of
payment of such fine the appellant shall further
undergo for a simple imprisonment for six months.
The appeal is partly allowed to the extent as
indicated above. ‚Äù
28. As such, in view of discussion made hereinabove, in light of
Section 32B of the NDPS Act coupled with above-quoted
principle of law laid down in Rafiq Qureshi (supra), since no
specific or any special reason has been assigned by the learned
trial Court for awarding sentence higher than minimum to the
appellants for having committed offence under Section 21(c) of
the NDPS Act, in the considered opinion of this Court, while
affirming the conviction of the appellants for offence under
