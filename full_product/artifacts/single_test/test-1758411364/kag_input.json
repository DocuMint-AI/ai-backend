Saraswat, learned counsel for the petitioner\n-Sandeep.\nShri Mukesh Kumawat, learned Public Prosecutor for\nthe respondent/State.\nBoth these bail petitions have arisen out of the same\ncrime number of the same police station, therefore, they are\nheard analogously and are being decided with this common\norder.\nO R D E R\n1. Both these petitions are the first bail applications of\nRanjan and Sandeep under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. in Crime\nNo.08/2018 under Sections 8/21 of the NDPS Act, 1985\nregistered at Police Station-Narcotics Cell, District-\nIndore.\n2. In short, the case of the prosecution is that on\n09.04.2018, Police Station, Narcotics Cell, Indore received\ninformation that last night i.e. 08.04.2018, Eskuf cough syrup\nhaving Codeine Phosphate is loaded in a truck bearing\nregistration No. M.P.-09-HH-1996 from a godown near\nCenter Point shrouded among bags of potatoes and onions.\nThe truck is parked at a petrol pump on A.B. Road before\n\n2. High Court of M.P.

The truck will depart about 5-5:30 P.M. If\nthe action is taken without delay, the contraband can be\nrecovered. Immediately a team headed by Inspector B.D.\nTripathi sent to the place indicated by the informer and a trap\nwas laid near Bridge of Kshipra River. After a while, the\nteam saw the truck coming from Dakachya side and got it\nstopped. Following due process, when the truck was\nsearched, 400 boxes containing 64000 bottles of 100 ml each\nof Eskuf Cough Syrup kept concealed amidst 145 bags of\nonions and 7 bags of potatoes were recovered. Driver\nMohanlal was having no document regarding transport of the\nsame, while at the same time; he was having all relevant\ndocuments regarding transportation of onion and potatoes.\n3. Mohanlal was taken into custody. On interrogation, he\ndisclosed that owner Kaushal Singh has taken the truck to the\ngodown of Gopal Mittal situated near Central Point,\nMangliai, Indore and from that godown, Ranjan Shukla (the\npetitioner) has loaded the syrup.\n4. The police went to the godown on next day i.e.\n10.04.2018, searched for Ranjan Shukla but he could not be\ntraced. The police sealed the godown. Next day on\n11.04.2018, the Police traced Ranjan Shukla and inquired\nregarding cough syrup, who revealed that the godown\nbelongs to Gopal Mittal and is taken on rent by proprietor of\nAnmol Medical, Manish Bhaskar, who operates his drugs\nbusiness from this godown and he works for Manish\n\n3.

He also revealed that 223 boxes of Eskuf Cough\nSyrup are still lying in the godown. The godown was\nunlocked and searched in his presence. 223 boxes of Eskuf\nSyrup containing 35680 bottles of 100 ML each were\nrecovered from the godown. No documents regarding storage\nof this cough syrup were produced by Ranjan Shukla. 13\nATM cards and 5 cheque books of several banks and a note\nbook, a challan book and two plastic seals were also\nrecovered from his possession.\n5. The police approached Gopal Mittal, who revealed that\nthe godown, from where the contraband was recovered,\nbelongs to his elder brother Biharilal. Biharilal disclosed that\nhis godown was taken on rent by Sandeep Kale (petitioner)\nfor vegetable business. The Police seized the rent agreement.\n6. The Police took out the samples from the seized articles\nand sent them to the FSL for chemical analyses, who\nconfirmed existence of Codeine Phosphate and\nchlorpheniramine maleate.\n7. Submissions of the petitioner Sandeep Kale are that he\nis a transporter and accepts goods to be transported in usual\ncourse of his business after verification of tax invoice and\nbills, keep them in his godown and got them loaded in the\ntrucks to deliver them at the destination. In the present case\nalso, the cartons were booked by one Anmol Medical stating\nthat they contain some medicines. He accepted the goods to\ntransport the same after verification of tax invoice and bills.\nHe or any of his employees was not concerned nor was\naware about the legality or illegality of the goods. He is not\n\n4. High Court of M.P. Bench At Indore\nMCRC No.26515/2018\nRanjan vs. The State of M.P.\n&\nMCRC Nos.46229/2018\nSandeep vs. The State of M.P.\nnamed in the FIR. Nothing is recovered from his possession.\nHe is in jail since 2/05/2018. The investigation is over and\ncharge-sheet is filed. Trial is likely to take time. He will\ncooperate with the trial. There is no possibility of his\nabsconding. Therefore, he be released on bail.\n8. Almost similar grounds have been taken by the\npetitioner Ranjan Shukla.\n9. In the arguments, much emphasis is been given by the\nlearned senior counsel that Section 21 of the NDPS Act\nprescribes punishment for dealing in “manufactured drug” in\ncontravention of any provision of The Act, 1985 or any Rule\nor Order made or condition of license granted there under.\n“Manufactured Drug” is defined in Section 2(xi) of The Act,\n1985. Clause (b) of Section 2(xi) of The Act provides that\n“Manufactured Drug” means any psychotropic substance or\npreparation which the Central Government may, having\nregard to the available information as to its nature or to a\ndecision, if any, under any International Convention, by\nnotification in the Official Gazette, declared to be a\n“manufactured drug”.\n10. In exercise of powers conferred under The Act, 1985,\nthe Central Government issued notification S.O.826 (E)\ndated 14.11.1985 and S.O.40 (E) dated 29.01.1993. Entry\nNo.35 of this notification defined specifications of Codeine,\nwhich reads as under:-\n“35. Methyl morphine (commonly known as\n'Codeine') and Ethyl morphine and their salts\n(including Dionine), all dilutions and preparations\nexcept those which are compounded with one or\nmore other ingredients and containing not more\n\n5. High Court of M.P. Bench At Indore\nMCRC No.26515/2018\nRanjan vs. The State of M.P.\n&\nMCRC Nos.46229/2018\nSandeep vs. The State of M.P.\nthan 100 milligrammes of the drug per dosage unit\nand with a concentration of not more than 2.5% in\nundivided preparations and which have been\nestablished in therapeutic practice.”\n11. It is averred that in the seizure memo of psychotropic\nsubstance itself it is mentioned that each dose of 5 ML\ncontains 10 mg Codeine Phosphate against permissive limit\nof 100 Mg. Similarly, its concentration is mentioned 1%\nagainst permissive limit of 2.5% in undivided preparations.\nThus, the substance seized by the police does not fall within\nthe definition of “manufactured drug” and is not punishable\nunder Section 21 of NDPS Act, 1985.\n12. It is further asserted by the learned Senior counsel that\nat the most, the case of the applicants falls under the Drugs\nand Cosmetics Act, for which, appropriate action can be\ntaken by the competent authority, but in any case, they\ncannot punished under the NDPS Act, 1985.\n13. To bolster his arguments, learned Senior counsel has\nplaced reliance on two orders of co-ordinate Bench of this\nCourt passed in the case of Shiv Kumar Gupta vs. The State\nof Madhya Pradesh dated 16.09.2015 passed in CRR\nNo.200/2015 and Rohit Chanda vs. The State of Madhya\nPradesh dated 15.10.2015 passed in CRR No.1621/2015\nwhere charges were quashed when the 5 ML of Cough Syrup\nwas containing 10 mg of codeine phosphate in the case of\nShiv Kumar (supra) and 9.825 mg codeine phosphate in the\ncase of Rohit Chanda (supra) holding that the quantity of\npsychotropic substance was within the permissible limit.\n14. A judgement of Punjab and Haryana High Court passed\n\n6. High Court of M.P. Bench At Indore\nMCRC No.26515/2018\nRanjan vs. The State of M.P.\n&\nMCRC Nos.46229/2018\nSandeep vs. The State of M.P.\nin Rajeev Kumar vs. the State of Punjab reported in 1998\nCri.L.J. 1460 is also pressed into service, where the\nproceedings were quashed by the Court on the similar line\nthat seized drug was containing contraband in the permissive\nlimit.\n15. Further reliance is placed by the learned Senior counsel\non the judgement of Binod Kumar @ Binod Kumar Bhagat\nvs. The State of Bihar reported in 2018 Cr.L.R (SC) 206\nwhere Hon'ble the Supreme Court has granted bail on the\nground that the applicant was only employee of the transport\ncompany which was engaged in the business of\ntransportation of goods and both the consignee and the\nconsignor were different companies/persons.\n16. On the other hand, learned Public Prosecutor has\ncontroverted each and every contention of the learned senior\ncounsel.\n17. Earlier, there was some controversy as to how the\nquantity of psychotropic substance found in any preparation\nor composition shall be calculated, but this controversy is\nnow set at rest. The Government of India has issued a\nnotification No. S.O. 2941(E) dated 18/11/2009. As per note\n4 appended at the end of this notification, it is made clear\nthat for the purpose of determining the quantity, the gross\nweight of the drug recovered and not the pure content of the\npsychotropic substance shall be taken into consideration.\nNote 4 reads thus:\n\"(4) The quantities shown in column 5 and\ncolumn 6 of the Table relating to the respective\n\n7. High Court of M.P. Bench At Indore\nMCRC No.26515/2018\nRanjan vs. The State of M.P.\n&\nMCRC Nos.46229/2018\nSandeep vs. The State of M.P.\ndrugs shown in column 2 shall apply to the\nentire mixture or any solution or any one or more\nnarcotic drugs or psychotropic substances of that\nparticular drug in dosage form or isomers, esters,\nether and salts of these drugs, including salts of\nesters, ethers and isomers, wherever existence of\nsuch substance is possible and not just its pure\ndrug content.\"\n18. The aforesaid notification is considered by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in Harjit Singh Vs. State of Punjab reported\nin 2011 Cr.L.R. (SC) 355. It is held that while considering\nthe quantity of the psychotropic substance, the whole\nquantity is to be taken into consideration.\n19. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Union of\nIndia and Anr. Vs. Sanjeev V Deshpande, reported in 2014\nCr.L.R. SC 896 (2014) 13 SCC 1 : (AIR 2014 SC 3625)\nconsidered the controversy as to whether the contents of\npsychotropic salt in the tablets could be separately counted\nfor calculating the weight or volume of psychotropic\nsubstance in medicinal preparation. The Supreme Court\nturned downed the contention and held that the gross weight\nof the drug is to be counted and not merely the net\npercentage/contents of the salt in the medicinal preparation\nfor finding out the actual weight of the drugs in reference to\nthe schedule under the NDPS Act.\n20. Same view has earlier been taken by the Hon'ble\nSuprme Court in the case of Shahabuddin and Ors. Vs.\nState of Assam, passed in Criminal Appeal No.629/2010\ndecided on 13/12/2012 reported in 2012(11) JT 310 : 2013\nAIR SCW 817 : (2012) 13 SCC 491. While considering the\nsimilar argument, the Court held that :\n\n8. High Court of M.P. Bench At Indore\nMCRC No.26515/2018\nRanjan vs. The State of M.P.\n&\nMCRC Nos.46229/2018\nSandeep vs. The State of M.P.\n\"10. At the very outset, the above said submission\nof the Learned Counsel is liable to be rejected,\ninasmuch as, the conduct of the appellants in having\ntransported huge quantity of 347 cartons containing\n100 bottles in each carton of 100 ml. Phensedyl\ncough syrup and 102 cartons, each carton\ncontaining 100 bottles of 100 ml. Recodex cough\nsyrup without valid documents for such\ntransportation cannot be heard to state that he was\nnot expected to fulfill any of the statutory\nrequirements either under the provisions of Drugs\nand Cosmetics Act or under the provisions of the\nN.D.P.S. Act.\n11. It is not in dispute that each 100 ml. bottle of\nPhensedyl cough syrup contained 183.15 to 189.85\nmg. of codeine phosphate and the each 100 ml.\nbottle of Recodex cough syrup contained 182.73\nmg. of codeine phosphate. When the appellants\nwere not in a position to explain as to whom the\nsupply was meant either for distribution or for any\nlicensed dealer dealing with pharmaceutical\nproducts and in the absence of any other valid\nexplanation for effecting the transportation of such\na huge quantity of the cough syrup which contained\nthe narcotic substance of codeine phosphate beyond\nthe prescribed limit, the application for grant of bail\ncannot be considered based on the above\nsubmissions made on behalf of the appellants.\n12. The submission of the Learned Counsel for the\nappellants was that the content of the codeine\nphosphate in each 100 ml. bottle if related to the\npermissible dosage, namely, 5 ml. would only result\nin less than 10 mg. of codeine phosphate thereby\nwould fall within the permissible limit as stipulated\nin the Notifications dated 14.11.1985 and\n29.1.1993. As rightly held by the High Court, the\nsaid contention should have satisfied the twin\nconditions, namely, that the contents of the narcotic\nsubstance should not be more than 100 mg. of\ncodeine, per dose unit and with a concentration of\nnot more than 2.5% in undivided preparation apart\nfrom the other condition, namely, that it should be\nonly for therapeutic practice. Therapeutic practice\nas per dictionary meaning means 'contributing to\ncure of disease'. In other words, the assessment of\n\n9. High Court of M.P. Bench At Indore\nMCRC No.26515/2018\nRanjan vs. The State of M.P.\n&\nMCRC Nos.46229/2018\nSandeep vs. The State of M.P.\ncodeine content on dosage basis can be made only\nwhen the cough syrup is definitely kept or\ntransported which is exclusively meant for its usage\nfor curing a disease and as an action of remedial\nagent.\n13. As pointed out by us earlier, since the appellants\nhad no documents in their possession to disclose as\nto for what purpose such a huge quantity of\nSchedule 'H' drug containing narcotic substance\nwas being transported and that too stealthily, it\ncannot be simply presumed that such transportation\nwas for therapeutic practice as mentioned in the\nNotifications dated 14.11.1985 and 29.1.1993.\nTherefore, if the said requirement meant for\ntherapeutic practice is not satisfied then in the event\nof the entire 100 ml. content of the cough syrup\ncontaining the prohibited quantity of codeine\nphosphate is meant for human consumption, the\nsame would certainly fall within the penal\nprovisions of the N.D.P.S. Act calling for\nappropriate punishment to be inflicted upon the\nappellants. Therefore, the appellants' failure to\nestablish the specific conditions required to be\nsatisfied under the above referred two notifications,\nthe application of the exemption provided under the\nsaid notifications in order to consider the appellants'\napplication for bail by the Courts below does not\narise.\"\n21. Time and again this Court has followed the law laid\ndown by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Shahabuddin and\nSanjeev Deshpande cases (supra) in MCRC No. 11448/2016\norder dated 13.12.2016, M.Cr.C.No.4310/2017 Gopal Gupta\nVs. The State of M.P. & Another order dated 11.05.2017,\nMCRC No. 20360/2018 order dated 28.05.2018 and in\nMCRC 26037 Nilesh @ Nilkamal V/s State of MP order\ndated 10.07.2018. The Rajsthan High Court has also taken\nthe same view in the case of Ravi alias Ravikant Vs. State of\nRajasthan reported in 2016 CRI. L. J. 3309 that the gross\nweight has to be considered for calculation of commercial\n\n10. High Court of M.P. Bench At Indore\nMCRC No.26515/2018\nRanjan vs. The State of M.P.\n&\nMCRC Nos.46229/2018\nSandeep vs. The State of M.P.\nquantity.\n22. Thus, it is evident that the whole quantity of material\nrecovered in the form of mixture is to be considered for the\npurpose of determining the quantity of psychotropic\nsubstance and when the psychotropic drug is kept in\npossession without any document to show that it was meant\nfor therapeutic use and the gross weight of psychotropic\nsubstance is well above the commercial quantity, the\nrestriction contained in Section 37 of the Narcotic Drugs and\nPsychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (61 of 1985) is directly\napplicable to the case of the petitioners. Nothing is on record\nto satisfy the conditions enunciated in this Section.\n23. Further, in the year 2015, The Government of India,\nMinistry of Finance (Department of Revenue), issued a\nnotification No.S.O.1181(E) dated 05.05.2015 and made\nCodeine as “essential narcotic drug”. Relevant paragraph\nno.1 of this notification reads thus:-\nS.O.1181(E). - In exercise of powers conferred by clause\n(viiia) of Section 2 of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic\nSubstances Act, 1985 (61 of 1985), the Central government\nhereby notices for medical and scientific use,the following\nnarcotic drugs to be essential narcotic drugs, namely:-\n(1)Methyl morphine (commonly known as\n'Codeine') and Ethyl Morphine and their salts\n(including Dionine), all dilutions and preparations\nexcept those which are compounded with one or\nmore other ingredients and containing not more\nthan 100 milligrammes of the drug per dosage unit\nand with a concentration of not more than 2.5% in\nundivided preparations and which have been\nestablished in therapeutic practice; (2)........\n(3)...........

A new Chapter “CHAPTER VA” is added\nin the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Rule,\n1985 by this amendment. For the sake of convenience,\nrelevant Rules of this Chapter-VA are being reproduced\nbelow:-\n“CHAPTER VA”\nPOSSESSION, TRANSPORT, IMPORT INTER-STATE,\nEXPORT INTER-STATE, SALE,PURCHASE,\nCONSUMPTION AND USE OF ESSENTIAL NARCOTIC\nDRUGS\n52A.

Thus, after May, 2015 licence to keep the composition\n\n14. High Court of M.P.

The incident in the present case is of the\nyear 2018, but nothing is there to show that the petitioners\nhave ever obtained or possessed any licence required by\nthese Rules.\n26. It is submitted by learned senior counsel that this Court\nis bound by earlier decision taken by a Bench of similar\nstrength. As earlier, different Single Benches of this Court\nhas taken a particular view; this Court is bound by that view\nand cannot take a different view. If this Court is of any\ndifferent view, in that case, at the most, the matter can be\nreferred to a Larger Bench; therefore, their application cannot\nbe thrown away.\n27. But, on the facts, the orders passed in Shiv Kumar\n(supra) and Rohit Chanda (supra) are distinguishable, as\nwhile quashing the charges on both the occasions, the learned\nSingle Bench of this Court has not considered the note\nappended to the notification No. S.O. 2941(E) dated\n18/11/2009 and also the judgement passed by Hon'ble the\napex Court in the case of Mohd. Shahabuddin and Sanjeev\nDeshpande (supra) and the notification No.S.O.1181(E)\ndated 05.05.2015 and Rules made thereunder, therefore, the\nplea of the learned senior counsel is not tenable.\n28. In any case, if we consider that the syrup containing\npsychotropic substance was in the permissive limit even then\nSection 8 of the Act, 1985 provides that no person shall\n\n15. High Court of M.P. Bench At Indore\nMCRC No.26515/2018\nRanjan vs. The State of M.P.\n&\nMCRC Nos.46229/2018\nSandeep vs. The State of M.P.\npossess narcotic drugs or psychotropic substance except for\nmedical or scientific purposes or in the manner and to the\nextent provided by the provisions of the Act or Rules or\nOrders made thereunder. Nothing is shown before this Court\nthat the seized contraband was stored or possessed for any\ntherapeutic purposes. No documents, whatsoever, are\nproduced by the petitioners. On the contrary the contraband\nwas concealed among the bags of potatoes and onion. The\ngodown was taken for storage of vegetables, but under the\nguise of vegetables, a huge quantity of psychotropic\nsubstance was stored and being transported stealthily. All this\nis sufficient to Prima facie show that the intention of the\npetitioners was not bonafide.\n29. In Mohd. Shahabuddin (supra) case Hon'ble the\nSupreme Court has also discussed this issue and has held that\napart from the other condition, it is mandatory that the\ncontraband should be only for therapeutic practice.\nTherapeutic practice means it should be for medicinal\npurposes only or should be exclusively meant for its usage\nfor curing a disease and as an action of remedial agent.\n30. At the cost of repetition I can refer para 13 of the\njudgement, which says that \"As pointed out by us earlier,\nsince the appellants had no documents in their possession to\ndisclose as to for what purpose such a huge quantity of\nSchedule 'H' drug containing narcotic substance was being\ntransported and that too stealthily, it cannot be simply\npresumed that such transportation was for therapeutic\npractice as mentioned in the Notifications dated 14.11.1985\n\n16. High Court of M.P. Bench At Indore\nMCRC No.26515/2018\nRanjan vs. The State of M.P.\n&\nMCRC Nos.46229/2018\nSandeep vs. The State of M.P.\nand 29.1.1993. Therefore, if the said requirement meant for\ntherapeutic practice is not satisfied then in the event of the\nentire 100 ml. content of the cough syrup containing the\nprohibited quantity of codeine phosphate is meant for human\nconsumption, the same would certainly fall within the penal\nprovisions of the N.D.P.S. Act calling for appropriate\npunishment to be inflicted upon the appellants. Therefore, the\nappellants' failure to establish the specific conditions\nrequired to be satisfied under the above referred two\nnotifications, the application of the exemption provided\nunder the said notifications in order to consider the\nappellants' application for bail by the Courts below does not\narise.\"\n31. The observation of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nreproduced herein above leaves no scope for this Court to\nentertain the contention canvassed by the learned counsel for\nthe petitioners particularly, looking to the quantity of bottles\nseized in the present case without any valid documents to\njustify the possession of such huge quantity of bottles.\n32. If, in view of the contention of the petitioners, we\nconsider only the net quantity of 20 mg of psychotropic\nsubstance, which each bottle seized contains and multiply\nthis with the total number of bottles (99680) seized, then the\ntotal quantity of Codeine comes to 1993600 mg, which is\nequal to 1.993 kg and it certainly is commercial quantity.\nConsidering this aspect also, the petitioners are not entitle for\nbail.\n33. In view of the foregoing discussions, in my considered\n\n17. High Court of M.P. Bench At Indore\nMCRC No.26515/2018\nRanjan vs. The State of M.P.\n&\nMCRC Nos.46229/2018\nSandeep vs. The State of M.P.\nopinion, no case for bail is made out. Therefore, both the\npetitions are dismissed hereby.\n(Virender Singh)\nJudge\namit",
