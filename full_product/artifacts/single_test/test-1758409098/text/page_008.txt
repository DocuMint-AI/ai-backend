8. High Court of M.P. Bench At Indore
MCRC No.26515/2018
Ranjan vs. The State of M.P.
&
MCRC Nos.46229/2018
Sandeep vs. The State of M.P.
"10. At the very outset, the above said submission
of the Learned Counsel is liable to be rejected,
inasmuch as, the conduct of the appellants in having
transported huge quantity of 347 cartons containing
100 bottles in each carton of 100 ml. Phensedyl
cough syrup and 102 cartons, each carton
containing 100 bottles of 100 ml. Recodex cough
syrup without valid documents for such
transportation cannot be heard to state that he was
not expected to fulfill any of the statutory
requirements either under the provisions of Drugs
and Cosmetics Act or under the provisions of the
N.D.P.S. Act.
11. It is not in dispute that each 100 ml. bottle of
Phensedyl cough syrup contained 183.15 to 189.85
mg. of codeine phosphate and the each 100 ml.
bottle of Recodex cough syrup contained 182.73
mg. of codeine phosphate. When the appellants
were not in a position to explain as to whom the
supply was meant either for distribution or for any
licensed dealer dealing with pharmaceutical
products and in the absence of any other valid
explanation for effecting the transportation of such
a huge quantity of the cough syrup which contained
the narcotic substance of codeine phosphate beyond
the prescribed limit, the application for grant of bail
cannot be considered based on the above
submissions made on behalf of the appellants.
12. The submission of the Learned Counsel for the
appellants was that the content of the codeine
phosphate in each 100 ml. bottle if related to the
permissible dosage, namely, 5 ml. would only result
in less than 10 mg. of codeine phosphate thereby
would fall within the permissible limit as stipulated
in the Notifications dated 14.11.1985 and
29.1.1993. As rightly held by the High Court, the
said contention should have satisfied the twin
conditions, namely, that the contents of the narcotic
substance should not be more than 100 mg. of
codeine, per dose unit and with a concentration of
not more than 2.5% in undivided preparation apart
from the other condition, namely, that it should be
only for therapeutic practice. Therapeutic practice
as per dictionary meaning means 'contributing to
cure of disease'. In other words, the assessment of
